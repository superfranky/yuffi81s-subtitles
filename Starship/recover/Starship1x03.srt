00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:54,070
Mission log.

2
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:57,130
Officer February of the galactic league

3
00:00:57,180 --> 00:00:58,970
starship ranger corps

4
00:00:59,020 --> 00:01:01,600
starship15A2.

5
00:01:01,650 --> 00:01:03,470
After x

6
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:05,830
number of years in space

7
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:09,190
we have reached the uncharted alien world

8
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:13,510
and are now prepping for human colonization.

9
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:16,460
Upon arriving in an exploration pod

10
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:19,870
it appears as though the planet's surface is

11
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,040
stable

12
00:01:21,670 --> 00:01:26,510
and there seem to be no signs of intelligent life forms anywhere.

13
00:01:27,460 --> 00:01:31,120
I will now analyze the air to see if it's breathable.

14
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:39,080
Hm,ahm... contains copious amounts of

15
00:01:39,130 --> 00:01:41,910
oxygen... but

16
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:44,480
I think I should be okay.

17
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:46,990
I will now remove my helmet...

18
00:01:54,290 --> 00:01:57,950
Let record show that I'm super ahead of schedule.

19
00:01:58,850 --> 00:02:01,330
As the ship's head shience officer

20
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:04,250
I will now scout the surrounding areas

21
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:06,940
looking for any and all signs... 
[sounds of animals]

22

Mission log.

23
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:12,360
I think I just heard a spooky noise!

24
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,440
And against my basic instincts

25
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:18,810
and everything that I learned at the academy training camp,

26
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:20,620
I will now approach the noise

27
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:23,150
for further investigation.

28
00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:24,990
Alright noise:

29
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:29,490
On behalf of the galactic league of extraterrestrial exploration


30
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:31,590
I demand you to show yourself!

31
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:33,050
Pika pi! [reference to: Pokémon]

32
00:02:33,050 --> 00:02:36,020
Aaaaaaaahhhh!

33
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:40,720
You are the cutest thing I've ever seen!

34
00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:41,770
Mission log.

35
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:43,490
Total plot twist!

36
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:46,030
That creepy noise I thought I heard

37
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:50,560
turned out to be the cutest effin' noise I've ever seen!

38
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:52,510
Mission log:

39
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:55,550
Get out! there are more of 'em.

40
00:02:55,830 --> 00:02:57,210
My stars!

41
00:02:57,260 --> 00:03:01,180
I seem to have landed in a field of these aminals!

42
00:03:02,570 --> 00:03:05,850
Hi! And what's your name?
[noises] 

43
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:07,980
Oh, I'm February!

44
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:14,520
Mission log. I've successfully made contact with the planet's indigenous life forms!

45
00:03:14,570 --> 00:03:17,580
And they are ultra friendly!

46
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:20,150
In my professional opinion

47
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:23,880
this planet is ready for human colonization by...

48
00:03:23,930 --> 00:03:26,300
this afternoon!

49
00:03:26,350 --> 00:03:28,550
That is if that's alright with all you.

50
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:29,720
[noises]

51
00:03:29,770 --> 00:03:32,230
Oh, I'm so glad to hear it.

52
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:33,870
You see,

53
00:03:34,270 --> 00:03:36,810
today is a really big day for me.

54
00:03:37,130 --> 00:03:39,090
Can I tell you guys something?

55
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:42,880
See, you might not believe this,

56
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:45,420
but this is my first mission.

57
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:50,030
Yeah. It's my chance to proof to everyone back home that

58
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:52,510
I am smart enough to get the job done.

59
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:54,230
Yeah.

60
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:56,660
And you know, back at the academy

61
00:03:56,710 --> 00:03:58,960
I finished the last in my class.

62
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:04,450
But it wasn't my fault! I mean how did they expect me to pass all those tests

63
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:07,400
if I didn't know any of the answers?

64
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:10,720
But being here with all of you guys,

65
00:04:10,770 --> 00:04:13,990
it just really makes me feel like I'm doing something great!

66
00:04:16,580 --> 00:04:17,790
Oh, hello!

67
00:04:18,830 --> 00:04:20,090
Are you alright?

68
00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:25,730
HOLY SHIT,

69
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:28,240
IT'S A BUUUUUG!!!!

70
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:35,740
Was that thing what I thought that thing was?

71
00:04:35,790 --> 00:04:36,590
I don't know.

72
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:38,860
But we better get it back to the boss.

73
00:04:38,910 --> 00:04:40,120
Come on!

74
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:44,640
So.

75
00:04:44,690 --> 00:04:47,090
First day being a wrangler bug, huh?

76
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:48,000
Yeah...

77
00:04:48,050 --> 00:04:50,710
I just got assigned this morning... [sigh]

78
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:53,250
Hey why the long slime hole?

79
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:56,490
Well, I just really had my dorsal tube set on being

80
00:04:56,540 --> 00:04:57,920
nourishment.

81
00:04:57,970 --> 00:04:58,970
Oh, I see.

82
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:01,890
Hey! Well, did you know that every egg in our swarm

83
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:06,000
starts out 
by parasitically chest eating in one of these mammals?

84
00:05:06,050 --> 00:05:08,430
And who do you think wrangles those mammals?

85
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:11,590
Mammal wranglers?!?

86
00:05:11,690 --> 00:05:13,310
Ha! That's right!

87
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,240
The whole process starts with us!

88
00:05:15,290 --> 00:05:18,500
So, you still think being a wrangler is lame?

89
00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:21,130
No! Now I think it's kind of neat!

90
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:22,330
Yep, it sure is.

91
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:25,100
-Now, come on! Let's go! 
-Oh boy!

92
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:29,390
Starship 15A2!

93
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:32,040
Come in, Starship 15A2!

94
00:05:32,090 --> 00:05:33,650
I need evac [military for evacuation]!

95
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:36,710
There are hostile eeky bugs down here!

96
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:39,800
Ah, where did it go?

97
00:05:40,490 --> 00:05:41,140
Ey,

98
00:05:41,190 --> 00:05:42,400
where's it go?

99
00:05:42,450 --> 00:05:44,880
Me thinks it went that away!

100
00:05:44,930 --> 00:05:46,690
I'm with you!

101
00:05:57,650 --> 00:05:58,940
Alright. Are you ready?

102
00:05:58,990 --> 00:06:03,000
Now the first thing, you're gonna wanna do is lay down a base code of slime.

103
00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:03,790
Go for it!

104
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:14,530
FML! [short for 'Fuck My Life']

105
00:06:15,070 --> 00:06:18,570
Hey Mister, what are them weird noises coming out of its mouthparts?

106
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:21,420
Hey! We don't talk to them, we just wrangle them!

107
00:06:21,470 --> 00:06:22,890
Now here's a tip:

108
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:26,750
Go ahead and secret a nice thick layer of mucus on to the mammals eyes

109
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,360
to temporarily blind it.

110
00:06:28,410 --> 00:06:30,690
We find this relaxes the mammals.

111
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:33,080
HELP!!!

112
00:06:33,130 --> 00:06:35,480
-HELP ME!!!! 
-Hey, wow!

113
00:06:35,530 --> 00:06:36,790
You're doing great!

114
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:39,620
Are you sure this is your first wrangle?

115
00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:42,070
You're just saying that...

116
00:06:42,910 --> 00:06:44,960
Hey! I don't just say stuff.

117
00:06:45,010 --> 00:06:47,500
Now come on, let's get her back to the hive.

118
00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:49,540
Starship Rangers!!!

119
00:06:49,590 --> 00:06:54,610
I need the Starship Rangers!!!!
