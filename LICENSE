Our subtitles are fanmade. We offer them to the world in the hope, that they will help people understand the shows and inspire others, to translate the shows into their languge.

So you may use them in any way you desire.
We don't gurantee they are correct (we are not native speakers).
Some of the subtitles contain words inappropriate for children.

It would be nice, if you would give us credit by mentioning our username in your work (like the video description on youtube).
