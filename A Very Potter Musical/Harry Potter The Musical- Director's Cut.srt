1
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:48,460
Underneath these stairs
I hear the sneers and feel the glares
of my cousin my uncle and my aunt

2
00:00:48,970 --> 00:00:58,120
Can't believe how cruel they are
and it stings my lightning scar
to know that they'll never ever give me what I want

3
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:08,370
I know I don't deserve these
stupid rules made by the Dursleys
here on Privet drive.

4
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:19,140
I can't take all of these muggles,
but despite all of my struggles,
I'm still alive.

5
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,060
I'm sick of summer and this waiting around.

6
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:26,640
Man, it's September, and I'm skipping this town

7
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:32,250
Hey it's no mystery, there's nothing here for me now

8
00:01:32,410 --> 00:01:35,600
I gotta get back to Hogwarts,

9
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:38,500
I gotta get back to school.

10
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:42,080
Gotta get myself to Hogwarts,

11
00:01:42,370 --> 00:01:46,230
where everybody knows I'm cool.

12
00:01:46,610 --> 00:01:50,340
Back to witches and wizards, and magical beasts,

13
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:53,980
to goblins and ghosts and to magical feasts.

14
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:57,180
It's all that I love, and it's all that I need.

15
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:01,120
At HOGWARTS, HOGWARTS, I think I'm going back

16
00:02:04,450 --> 00:02:07,700
I'll see my friends, gonna laugh 'til we cry

17
00:02:07,970 --> 00:02:11,150
take my Firebolt, gonna take to the sky

18
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:17,690
NO WAY this year anyone's gonna die,
and it's gonna be totally awesome

19
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:21,160
I'll cast some spells, with a flick of my wand

20
00:02:21,230 --> 00:02:24,680
defeat the dark arts, yeah bring it on!

21
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:30,860
and do it all with my best friend Ron,
'cuz together we're totally awesome

22
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:34,440
yeah, and it's gonna be totally awesome!

23
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:36,740
Did somebody say Ron Weasley?

24
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:38,790
what's up, buddy?

25
00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:43,070
so it took me so long to get here. I had to get some...

26
00:02:43,070 --> 00:02:46,020
Floopowder, but we gotta get going,
come on, get your trunk, let's go!

27
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:46,720
Where are we going?

28
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:47,880
To Diagon Alley, of course!

29
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:48,540
Cool!

30
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:49,100
Come on!

31
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:54,110
Floopowderpower! Floopowderpower! 
Floopowderpower! Floopowderpower! 

32
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:58,160
It's been so long, but we're going back

33
00:02:58,390 --> 00:03:01,640
don't go for work, don't go there for class

34
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:03,460
As long as we're together -

35
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:08,670
- gonna kick some ass and it's gonna be totally awesome!

36
00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:11,890
This year we'll take everybody by storm,

37
00:03:11,990 --> 00:03:14,990
stay up all night, sneak out of our dorm

38
00:03:14,990 --> 00:03:18,330
But let's not forget
that we need to perform well in class

39
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:21,700
if we want to pass our OWLS!

40
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:24,870
God, Hermione, why do you have to be such a buzzkill?

41
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:27,460
Because, guys, school's not all about having fun.

42
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:31,030
We need to study hard if we wanna be good witches and wizards!

43
00:03:31,830 --> 00:03:34,920
I may be frumpy, but I'm super smart

44
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:38,240
check out my grades, they're "A's" for a start

45
00:03:38,390 --> 00:03:41,450
what I lack in looks well
I make up in heart,

46
00:03:41,450 --> 00:03:44,610
and well guys, yeah, that's totally awesome

47
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:48,160
this year I plan to study a lot

48
00:03:48,330 --> 00:03:51,540
that would be cool if you were actually hot

49
00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:54,760
hey Ron, come on, we're the only friends that she's got!

50
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:55,460
and that's cool

51
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:57,770
and that's totally awesome

52
00:03:57,770 --> 00:04:00,980
yeah it's so cool, and it's totally awesome!

53
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:05,870
Sick of summer and this waiting around

54
00:04:06,170 --> 00:04:09,360
it's like we're sitting in the lost and found

55
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:11,500
don't take no sorcery

56
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:14,820
for anyone to see how

57
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:18,080
we gotta get back to Hogwarts

58
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:21,550
we gotta get back to school

59
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:24,720
we gotta get back to Hogwarts

60
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:28,940
where everything is magic-cooooool

61
00:04:29,450 --> 00:04:32,990
back to witches and wizards, and magical beasts

62
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,320
to goblins and ghosts and to magical feasts

63
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:39,720
it's all that I love, and it's all that I need at

64
00:04:39,730 --> 00:04:41,860
HOGWARTS, HOGWARTS

65
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:43,000
I think we're going back

66
00:04:43,615 --> 00:04:44,825
Roooon!

67
00:04:45,375 --> 00:04:49,725
You're supposed to take me to Madam Malkins,
and you used all those sickles mum gave you
for my robe fittings!

68
00:04:50,005 --> 00:04:50,505
Who's this?

69
00:04:50,795 --> 00:04:52,865
This is my stupid little dump sister Ginny,

70
00:04:52,865 --> 00:04:53,815
she's a freshman,

71
00:04:53,815 --> 00:04:57,235
Ginny, this is Harry.
Harry Potter,
He's Harry Potter.

72
00:04:57,235 --> 00:05:00,665
Oh, you're Harry Potter!
you're the boy who lived!

73
00:05:00,665 --> 00:05:01,665
Yeah, and you're Ginny.

74
00:05:01,665 --> 00:05:03,075
It's Ginevra.

75
00:05:03,075 --> 00:05:04,715
Cool. Ginny is fine.

76
00:05:04,715 --> 00:05:06,285
Stupid sister

77
00:05:06,285 --> 00:05:08,175
don't bother famous friend!

78
00:05:08,175 --> 00:05:09,915
Do you guy's hear music or something?

79
00:05:09,925 --> 00:05:11,205
Music? What are you talking about?

80
00:05:11,205 --> 00:05:13,215
Yeah, someone's coming.
Someone's coming.

81
00:05:15,145 --> 00:05:16,535
Cho Chang

82
00:05:16,535 --> 00:05:18,395
Domo arigato

83
00:05:18,425 --> 00:05:21,545
Cho, Chang

84
00:05:21,545 --> 00:05:23,165
Gung Hey Fat Choy Chang

85
00:05:23,165 --> 00:05:26,345
Happy Happy New Year,
Cho Chang

86
00:05:28,885 --> 00:05:30,515
Oh! Who's that?

87
00:05:31,185 --> 00:05:32,205
That's Cho Chang.

88
00:05:32,205 --> 00:05:35,435
That's the girl Harry's totally been in love
with since freshman year.

89
00:05:35,435 --> 00:05:37,475
Yeah, but he won't say anything to her.

90
00:05:37,475 --> 00:05:40,485
Yeah, you never tell a girl you like her,
it makes you look like an idiot.

91
00:05:42,855 --> 00:05:44,795
Conichiwa, Cho Chang.

92
00:05:44,805 --> 00:05:46,205
It is good to meet you.

93
00:05:46,205 --> 00:05:48,475
I am Ginny Weasley.

94
00:05:48,735 --> 00:05:50,285
Bitch, I ain't Cho chang!

95
00:05:51,725 --> 00:05:53,215
That's Lavender Brown!

96
00:05:57,115 --> 00:05:58,605
Hey, hey it's alright. I'm Cho Chang ya'll!

97
00:05:59,725 --> 00:06:00,885
She's totally perfect!

98
00:06:00,885 --> 00:06:03,555
Yeah, too bad she's dating
Cedric Diggory though, ah?

99
00:06:03,555 --> 00:06:05,295
Who the hell is Cedric Diggory?

100
00:06:05,625 --> 00:06:07,095
What's that? Who is that guy?

101
00:06:07,795 --> 00:06:10,015
Oh, Cho Chang!

102
00:06:10,015 --> 00:06:14,675
I am so in love with
Cho Chang.

103
00:06:14,675 --> 00:06:19,185
from Bangkok to DingDang

104
00:06:19,185 --> 00:06:25,435
I sing my love aloud for Cho Chang!

105
00:06:26,135 --> 00:06:28,075
I hate that guy!
I hate him!

106
00:06:28,075 --> 00:06:29,705
So are we gonna get these robes or not?

107
00:06:29,705 --> 00:06:31,095
Okay, alright let's GO!

108
00:06:31,095 --> 00:06:32,315
God, sister!

109
00:06:37,305 --> 00:06:39,425
Present your arm, nerd!

110
00:06:39,435 --> 00:06:40,175
What, what, what...?

111
00:06:40,175 --> 00:06:42,185
Indian Burn hex!

112
00:06:44,925 --> 00:06:47,975
Oh, Crabbe and Goyle.

113
00:06:47,975 --> 00:06:49,435
Are you okay?

114
00:06:49,435 --> 00:06:51,765
Why don't you leave Neville Longbottom alone, ha?

115
00:06:51,765 --> 00:06:54,815
Well well well if it isn't
Harry Potter.

116
00:06:54,815 --> 00:06:58,985
You think all because you're famous
you can boss everyone around.

117
00:06:58,985 --> 00:07:02,295
No, I just don't think it's cool for guys of your size
picking on guys like Neville, come on!

118
00:07:02,295 --> 00:07:03,825
Oh well you know what I think?

119
00:07:03,835 --> 00:07:06,515
I think glasses are for nerds!

120
00:07:08,395 --> 00:07:09,755
We hate nerds!

121
00:07:09,755 --> 00:07:10,915
And girls!

122
00:07:11,265 --> 00:07:12,785
Wow! Well you asked for it!

123
00:07:12,785 --> 00:07:14,045
You don't mess with Harry Potter,

124
00:07:14,045 --> 00:07:16,045
he beat the dark Lord when he was a baby!

125
00:07:16,055 --> 00:07:18,095
All right,
everyone just calm down.

126
00:07:18,095 --> 00:07:19,095
Occulus reparo!

127
00:07:19,735 --> 00:07:20,725
Wow, cool!

128
00:07:23,115 --> 00:07:26,535
Now let's leave these big babychildish jerks alone.

129
00:07:26,535 --> 00:07:29,815
Did someone say
Draco Malfoy?

130
00:07:33,635 --> 00:07:34,955
What do you want, Draco?

131
00:07:35,155 --> 00:07:36,465
Crabbe, Golyle,

132
00:07:36,845 --> 00:07:40,025
be a pair of proper drones and 
go pay for my robes, will you?

133
00:07:40,625 --> 00:07:42,115
So Potter!

134
00:07:42,455 --> 00:07:45,075
Back for another year at Hogwarts, are you?

135
00:07:45,085 --> 00:07:49,555
Maybe this year you'll wise up and hang out
with the higher caliber wizard.

136
00:07:49,555 --> 00:07:50,175
Listen,

137
00:07:51,495 --> 00:07:53,225
Ron and Hermine are my
best friends in the whole world,

138
00:07:53,225 --> 00:07:54,765
I wouldn't trade them for anything.

139
00:07:55,965 --> 00:07:57,475
Have it your way.

140
00:07:57,715 --> 00:07:58,765
Wait!

141
00:07:59,085 --> 00:08:00,785
Don't tell me!

142
00:08:00,785 --> 00:08:02,115
Red hair,

143
00:08:02,115 --> 00:08:05,755
hand me down clothes
and a stupid complexion.

144
00:08:06,125 --> 00:08:07,995
You must be a Weasley!

145
00:08:07,995 --> 00:08:09,665
Oh my god, lay off,
Malfoy!

146
00:08:09,665 --> 00:08:11,695
She may be a pain in the ass, okay?

147
00:08:11,695 --> 00:08:13,385
But she's my pain in the ass.

148
00:08:13,385 --> 00:08:15,545
Well, isn't this cute?

149
00:08:15,545 --> 00:08:17,875
It's like a little loser family.

150
00:08:18,415 --> 00:08:20,555
Hogwarts is really going to the dogs.

151
00:08:20,925 --> 00:08:25,365
Luckily next year I'll be transfered to Pigfarts.

152
00:08:26,075 --> 00:08:28,885
This year you bet I'm gonna get outta here

153
00:08:29,025 --> 00:08:31,965
the reign of Malfoy is drawing near

154
00:08:32,275 --> 00:08:35,095
I'll have the greatest wizard career,

155
00:08:35,105 --> 00:08:38,065
and it's gonna be totally awesome

156
00:08:38,475 --> 00:08:41,375
Look out world, for the dawn of the day

157
00:08:41,375 --> 00:08:44,595
When everyone will do whatever I say

158
00:08:44,595 --> 00:08:46,645
And that Potter won't be in my way,

159
00:08:46,645 --> 00:08:50,475
and then I'll be the one who is totally awesome!

160
00:08:50,485 --> 00:08:53,845
Yeah you'll be the one who is totally awesome.

161
00:08:54,855 --> 00:08:57,305
Guys, come on! We're gonna miss the train!

162
00:09:01,235 --> 00:09:04,395
Who knows how fast this year's gonna go?

163
00:09:04,395 --> 00:09:07,625
Hand me a glass, let the butterbeer flow

164
00:09:07,625 --> 00:09:10,635
Maybe at last, I'm gonna talk to Cho

165
00:09:10,635 --> 00:09:13,625
Oh no, that'd be WAY too awesome

166
00:09:13,625 --> 00:09:16,695
We're back to learn everything that we can

167
00:09:16,885 --> 00:09:19,855
It's great to come back to where we began

168
00:09:19,855 --> 00:09:22,985
And here we are, and alakazam!

169
00:09:22,985 --> 00:09:25,915
here we go, this is totally awesome!

170
00:09:29,035 --> 00:09:31,605
Come on and teach us everything you know

171
00:09:32,075 --> 00:09:34,805
The summer's over and were itchin to go

172
00:09:35,185 --> 00:09:36,825
I think we're ready for:

173
00:09:37,085 --> 00:09:38,555
Albus Dumbledore!

174
00:09:38,555 --> 00:09:41,695
Oooooo

175
00:09:41,695 --> 00:09:43,575
Aaaaaah

176
00:09:43,575 --> 00:09:51,265
Welcome,

177
00:09:51,265 --> 00:09:53,905
all of you to Hogwarts

178
00:09:54,435 --> 00:09:58,465
I welcome all of you to school

179
00:09:58,965 --> 00:10:02,195
Did you know that here at Hogwarts

180
00:10:02,725 --> 00:10:06,535
We've got a hidden swimming pool?

181
00:10:06,845 --> 00:10:10,135
Welcome, welcome, welcome Hogwarts

182
00:10:10,735 --> 00:10:14,645
Welcome hotties, nerds, and tools

183
00:10:14,905 --> 00:10:18,165
Now that I've got you here at Hogwarts

184
00:10:18,725 --> 00:10:21,155
I'd like to go over just a couple of rules:

185
00:10:21,575 --> 00:10:24,715
My name is Albus Dumbledore and I am headmaster of Hogwarts.

186
00:10:24,955 --> 00:10:27,305
You could all call me Dumbledore.

187
00:10:27,555 --> 00:10:30,705
Of course you could also call me Albus if you wanted detention.

188
00:10:31,235 --> 00:10:34,035
I'm just kidding.
I'll expell you if you call me Albus!

189
00:10:35,965 --> 00:10:39,395
back to witches and wizards, and magical beasts

190
00:10:39,445 --> 00:10:42,485
to goblins and ghosts and to magical feasts

191
00:10:42,885 --> 00:10:45,645
it's all that I love, and it's all that I need.

192
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:47,925
at HOGWARTS, HOGWARTS

193
00:10:50,115 --> 00:10:53,415
Back to spells and enchantments, potions and friends

194
00:10:53,415 --> 00:10:54,495
To Gryffindors!

195
00:10:54,495 --> 00:10:55,195
Hufflepuffs!

196
00:10:55,195 --> 00:10:55,965
Ravenclaws!

197
00:10:55,965 --> 00:10:56,745
Slytherins!

198
00:10:56,745 --> 00:10:59,665
Back to the place where our story begins

199
00:10:59,665 --> 00:11:01,755
It's Hogwarts, Hogwarts!

200
00:11:01,755 --> 00:11:03,225
I'm sorry, what's it's name?

201
00:11:03,225 --> 00:11:04,705
Hogwarts, Hogwarts!

202
00:11:04,705 --> 00:11:06,215
I didn't hear you kids!

203
00:11:06,215 --> 00:11:07,655
Hogwarts, Hogwarts!

204
00:11:07,975 --> 00:11:09,455
Man, I'm glad I'm back.

205
00:11:22,727 --> 00:11:26,527
Welcome to another magical year at Hogwarts.

206
00:11:26,637 --> 00:11:29,687
And a very special welcome to my favourite student:

207
00:11:29,687 --> 00:11:31,807
Mr. Harry Potter.

208
00:11:32,937 --> 00:11:35,727
He killed Voldemort when he was just a baby.

209
00:11:35,727 --> 00:11:39,057
He's even got that little lightning scar there to prove it.

210
00:11:40,307 --> 00:11:43,927
And another very special welcome to our newest addition to Gryffindor:

211
00:11:43,927 --> 00:11:45,107
Mr. Ginny...

212
00:11:45,107 --> 00:11:47,667
Excuse me!
Mrs. Ginny Weasley.

213
00:11:48,777 --> 00:11:50,547
Yeah, I'm a girl, and ahm...

214
00:11:50,547 --> 00:11:54,857
Also... aren't we supposed to be sorted by the sorting hat?

215
00:11:54,857 --> 00:11:55,527
Well ahm...

216
00:11:55,537 --> 00:11:57,477
a funny thing happened to the sorting hat.

217
00:11:57,477 --> 00:12:01,197
he actually got hitched with another piece of enchanted magical clothing.

218
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:07,587
So he and the scarf of sexual preference aren't going to be back until next year.

219
00:12:10,447 --> 00:12:14,027
Basically I've just been putting anyone who looks like a good guy into Gryffindor,

220
00:12:14,027 --> 00:12:16,067
anybody who looks like a bad guy into Slytherin,

221
00:12:16,067 --> 00:12:17,687
and the other two can just go where ever the hell they want,

222
00:12:17,687 --> 00:12:18,377
I don't even care.

223
00:12:20,707 --> 00:12:23,427
Hufflepuffs are particularly good FINDers.

224
00:12:23,427 --> 00:12:25,797
What the hell is a Hufflepuff?

225
00:12:30,767 --> 00:12:31,727
Anyway,

226
00:12:31,727 --> 00:12:34,277
it's time now for me,
to introduce my very good friend,

227
00:12:34,277 --> 00:12:35,707
our own potions professor:

228
00:12:35,707 --> 00:12:37,867
Mr. Severus Snape.

229
00:12:37,867 --> 00:12:38,767
Oh man!

230
00:12:38,767 --> 00:12:40,987
Not Snape! I hoped, they had fired that guy.

231
00:12:40,987 --> 00:12:44,437
What's wrong with professor snape?
Oh, Nothing. He's just uuuh EVIL!

232
00:12:55,087 --> 00:12:57,357
Come on, Ron, he's really not that bad...

233
00:12:57,907 --> 00:12:59,587
Harry Potter!

234
00:13:01,297 --> 00:13:02,397
Detention!

235
00:13:02,837 --> 00:13:03,537
For what?

236
00:13:03,827 --> 00:13:05,717
For talking out of turn!

237
00:13:07,507 --> 00:13:09,407
Now before we begin...

238
00:13:09,407 --> 00:13:13,387
I'm going to give you all your very very first pop quiz.

239
00:13:15,177 --> 00:13:17,897
Can anyone tell me what a Portkey is?

240
00:13:17,897 --> 00:13:18,867
Ah yes, Mrs. Granger!

241
00:13:18,867 --> 00:13:21,677
A Portkey is an enchanted object
that when touched will transport the one or ones who touched it,

242
00:13:21,677 --> 00:13:24,157
to anywhere in the world decided upon by the enchanter.

243
00:13:24,157 --> 00:13:25,697
Very good!

244
00:13:27,307 --> 00:13:30,487
Now can anyone tell me what foreshadowing is?

245
00:13:30,917 --> 00:13:31,917
Ah yes, Mrs. Granger!

246
00:13:31,927 --> 00:13:34,997
Foreshadowing is a dramatic device, in which an
important plot point is mentioned early in the story

247
00:13:34,997 --> 00:13:37,667
to return later in a most difficult way.

248
00:13:39,927 --> 00:13:41,177
Perfect.

249
00:13:41,177 --> 00:13:43,447
What's a portkey again ? I missed some of that.

250
00:13:43,447 --> 00:13:45,847
Oh, a Portkey is something that when you touch it, that would transport you...

251
00:13:46,407 --> 00:13:50,607
And remember a Portkey can be a sort of seemly harmless object.

252
00:13:50,617 --> 00:13:51,647
Like...a football...

253
00:13:52,127 --> 00:13:53,357
or... a Dolphin...

254
00:13:55,117 --> 00:13:56,277
Professor?

255
00:13:56,277 --> 00:13:58,107
Can like a person be a Portkey?

256
00:13:58,107 --> 00:13:59,537
No that's absurd!

257
00:14:00,887 --> 00:14:03,667
Cause then when a person were to touch themselves...

258
00:14:07,637 --> 00:14:11,107
...they would constantly be transported into different places.

259
00:14:11,707 --> 00:14:13,957
A person can however be a horcrux.

260
00:14:13,957 --> 00:14:15,357
What's a... what's a horcrux?

261
00:14:15,357 --> 00:14:18,177
I'm not even going to tell you, Harry.
You'll find out soon enough.

262
00:14:19,727 --> 00:14:21,277
Professor, what's the point of this quiz?

263
00:14:21,277 --> 00:14:24,107
Oh no no. No point in particular.

264
00:14:24,107 --> 00:14:27,327
Just important information that everyone should know.

265
00:14:28,137 --> 00:14:29,327
Especially you!

266
00:14:30,547 --> 00:14:33,637
Now, moving right along. There are four houses in all.

267
00:14:33,637 --> 00:14:34,807
Gryffindor,

268
00:14:35,207 --> 00:14:36,597
Ravenclaw,

269
00:14:36,597 --> 00:14:37,457
Hufflepuff...

270
00:14:37,457 --> 00:14:37,967
FIND!

271
00:14:37,967 --> 00:14:38,697
...what?!?

272
00:14:41,937 --> 00:14:43,247
And Slytherin.

273
00:14:44,717 --> 00:14:45,977
Traditionell...

274
00:14:49,347 --> 00:14:53,477
Traditionally points are given for good behavior and adducted for rule-breaking.

275
00:14:53,697 --> 00:14:56,627
Example: Ten points from Gryffinfor!

276
00:14:56,627 --> 00:14:57,687
What?!?

277
00:14:57,687 --> 00:14:59,747
For Miss Grangers excessive baby fat.

278
00:15:02,227 --> 00:15:03,437
Thanks Hermione.

279
00:15:03,687 --> 00:15:07,497
Traditionally the house with the most points at the end of the year would win the house cup.

280
00:15:07,877 --> 00:15:10,257
However, this year we're doing things a bit different.

281
00:15:10,657 --> 00:15:14,077
Here to introduce you is our new professor of the dark arts:

282
00:15:14,477 --> 00:15:15,507
Professor Quirrell!

283
00:15:16,107 --> 00:15:17,067
Harry, what's wrong?

284
00:15:35,767 --> 00:15:37,057
The house cup...

285
00:15:37,477 --> 00:15:39,337
...a time honored tradition.

286
00:15:40,067 --> 00:15:40,777
For centuries...

287
00:15:40,777 --> 00:15:42,137
Go home, terrorist!

288
00:15:46,857 --> 00:15:53,817
For centuries, the four houses of Hogwarts have competed for the honor and glory of holding the title of house champion.

289
00:15:54,107 --> 00:15:58,277
But where does this competition come from and what are the - roots of the tradition?

290
00:15:58,397 --> 00:16:01,047
The house cup tournament began with the first generation of Hogwarts students.

291
00:16:01,797 --> 00:16:03,497
That was a rhetorical question!

292
00:16:04,577 --> 00:16:05,897
Granger, quit interrupting!

293
00:16:05,897 --> 00:16:07,377
20 points from Gryffindor!

294
00:16:07,637 --> 00:16:08,897
Thanks, Hermione.

295
00:16:09,537 --> 00:16:14,827
As I was saying: when the tournament first originated, it was one of a completely different sort.

296
00:16:15,267 --> 00:16:20,667
One champion from each of the four houses would complete a series of dangerous tasks.

297
00:16:20,987 --> 00:16:25,917
Challenges, the winner would not only win the cup - he would also win the eternal glory.

298
00:16:25,917 --> 00:16:29,127
Kinda like a house cup - ar no... like a triwizard tournament.

299
00:16:29,687 --> 00:16:32,337
Yes... sort of like the triwizard tournament.

300
00:16:32,577 --> 00:16:34,837
Except - no, not like that at all!

301
00:16:35,607 --> 00:16:39,737
There are four houses. How can it be the TRIwizard tournament with FOUR teams?

302
00:16:39,737 --> 00:16:44,397
Well, ah... professor, if I remember correctly, the house cup tournament was dispended after one semester...

303
00:16:44,567 --> 00:16:47,157
...when one of it's students was killed during the first task.

304
00:16:47,387 --> 00:16:51,567
Yes, it is very dangerous. But the rewards far outweigh the risks.

305
00:16:52,147 --> 00:16:54,327
I - I don't think you heard me. I just said somebody died!

306
00:16:54,327 --> 00:16:58,027
Hermione Granger, shut your ungodly lopsided mouth and quit interrupting!

307
00:16:58,027 --> 00:16:59,057
20 more Points!

308
00:16:59,247 --> 00:17:00,437
Thanks, Hermione.

309
00:17:02,447 --> 00:17:06,107
Come on! For the cleverest witch of your age, you really can be a dumb ass somehow.

310
00:17:08,577 --> 00:17:10,667
10 Points to Dumbledore!

311
00:17:13,527 --> 00:17:19,497
Yes, yes - well, it will be very dangerous, but the winner will be remembered as a hero for ages to come.

312
00:17:19,727 --> 00:17:27,907
And as the professor of defence against the dark arts, I believe that this - practical application is exactly what the curriculum needs to...

313
00:17:27,907 --> 00:17:29,017
Achoo!

314
00:17:29,237 --> 00:17:30,207
Gesundheit.

315
00:17:34,467 --> 00:17:36,747
Did your turban just sneeze?

316
00:17:37,197 --> 00:17:39,007
W...What? - No!

317
00:17:39,007 --> 00:17:43,027
I could have sworn I heard a sneeze coming from your direction, but your mouth wasn't moving.

318
00:17:43,027 --> 00:17:47,017
No,...that - that was simply a fart, excuse me.

319
00:17:48,217 --> 00:17:49,277
Achoo!

320
00:17:50,547 --> 00:17:51,417
Achoo!

321
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:54,437
I must be going.

322
00:17:56,817 --> 00:17:57,877
Achoo!

323
00:17:57,877 --> 00:18:00,077
I simply farted once more, excuse me!

324
00:18:01,807 --> 00:18:07,897
With the newly resurrected house cup, a champion from each house will be selected to compete.

325
00:18:08,037 --> 00:18:10,517
So Snape: would you do us the honors, please?

326
00:18:10,517 --> 00:18:11,937
Yes, headmaster.

327
00:18:13,227 --> 00:18:16,277
First, from the Ravenclaw house:

328
00:18:17,737 --> 00:18:19,137
Mrs. Cho Chang!

329
00:18:19,137 --> 00:18:21,867
Oh my god, I won! Who can it believe - I can't.

330
00:18:23,817 --> 00:18:25,577
And next from Hufflepuff:

331
00:18:27,087 --> 00:18:29,177
Mr. Cedric Diggory!

332
00:18:30,047 --> 00:18:32,407
Well, I don't FIND this surprising at all.

333
00:18:34,387 --> 00:18:38,177
I find it perfect. Now I can spend more time with my beloved boyfriend.

334
00:18:38,307 --> 00:18:39,987
I'm glad as well, my darling!

335
00:18:40,507 --> 00:18:43,527
And next, from the Slytherin house:

336
00:18:44,497 --> 00:18:46,157
Draco Malfoy!

337
00:18:48,147 --> 00:18:50,357
I finally beat you, didn't I, Potter?

338
00:18:50,557 --> 00:18:53,667
What you think of that, ha? I'm the champion this time!

339
00:18:55,317 --> 00:18:58,627
Draco would you sit down ya little shit! 'Champion' is just a title!

340
00:19:02,337 --> 00:19:05,747
And finally from the Gryffindor house:

341
00:19:06,617 --> 00:19:08,167
... oh my!

342
00:19:08,517 --> 00:19:10,197
Isn't this curious?

343
00:19:10,397 --> 00:19:14,137
The one person in all of Hogwarts whom I have grown a grudge against,

344
00:19:14,287 --> 00:19:17,907
is suddenly in a tournament, where he may very well lose his life.

345
00:19:17,917 --> 00:19:21,397
It...It's me! Apologies to my fellow Gryffindors right now, for losing

346
00:19:21,907 --> 00:19:24,587
Sit down, you inarticulated bump!

347
00:19:25,547 --> 00:19:26,717
It's Harry Potter!

348
00:19:31,347 --> 00:19:38,697
That's really all, folks. The four Hogwarts champions: I want all of you to start preparing immediately, because the first task is in two month.

349
00:19:38,777 --> 00:19:40,837
And it could be anything...

350
00:19:41,177 --> 00:19:42,587
So let's get to it! Ha ha!

351
00:19:44,347 --> 00:19:49,237
Cho Chang! Cho Chang! Cho Chang!
Draco Malf... Drac... hey...!

352
00:19:50,164 --> 00:19:52,614
Harry, you've got this tournament in the bag.

353
00:19:52,744 --> 00:19:54,854
I don't know man,
this Cedric Diggory is pretty awesome

354
00:19:54,854 --> 00:19:55,364
NOT!!!

355
00:19:55,374 --> 00:19:56,114
He sucks!

356
00:19:56,114 --> 00:19:57,704
I'm totally gonna win! It's in the bag!

357
00:19:59,564 --> 00:20:00,894
I don't know Harry...

358
00:20:00,894 --> 00:20:02,944
Oh my God!
Hermione shut up!

359
00:20:04,814 --> 00:20:07,174
Why do you have to rain
on everybody's parade?

360
00:20:07,174 --> 00:20:09,994
Because, RON, this is dangerous!

361
00:20:09,994 --> 00:20:13,284
Dangerous? Oh come on, Hermione,
how dangerous can it be,
especially for me?

362
00:20:13,284 --> 00:20:16,474
Wha... You're not invincible, Harry!
Somebody died in this tournament!

363
00:20:16,474 --> 00:20:19,204
Oh! I'm the boy that lived, not died!

364
00:20:20,334 --> 00:20:21,414
What's the worst that can happen?

365
00:20:21,414 --> 00:20:23,174
And...and I don't know about that
Quirrell-character.

366
00:20:23,394 --> 00:20:26,144
You know, first he resurrects some
horrible ancient tournament,

367
00:20:26,144 --> 00:20:28,244
then when he bumps into you your
scar starts to burn,

368
00:20:28,244 --> 00:20:31,294
and you have to admit, there's something
really funky about the back of his head!

369
00:20:32,604 --> 00:20:36,624
Come on, think about it: Professor Quirrell
is a Professor and who hires the Professors?

370
00:20:36,784 --> 00:20:37,524
Dumbledore!

371
00:20:37,524 --> 00:20:40,174
He`s the smartest, most awesomest...
practical wizard...

372
00:20:40,294 --> 00:20:40,784
Beautiful!

373
00:20:40,784 --> 00:20:42,434
...beautiful wizard in the whole world,

374
00:20:42,434 --> 00:20:45,534
why... Why would he possibly hire somebody
that's trying to hurt me?

375
00:20:45,534 --> 00:20:47,324
Wha...wha... I mean, what about Snape?

376
00:20:47,474 --> 00:20:48,544
Yeah, what about him?

377
00:20:49,024 --> 00:20:50,634
He's hated you for years!

378
00:20:50,794 --> 00:20:53,484
And he's hated your parents, too, Harry,
everybody knows that!

379
00:20:54,064 --> 00:20:57,054
And he... he just so happens to pick
your name out of the house cup

380
00:20:57,054 --> 00:21:00,044
out of  HUNDREDS,
if not FIVE possible Gryffindors...?

381
00:21:01,664 --> 00:21:03,414
What a coincidence, we lucked out.

382
00:21:03,414 --> 00:21:05,434
No, Harry, I don't think it is a coincidence!

383
00:21:05,704 --> 00:21:08,614
When you defeated Voldemort
you made a lot of enemies.

384
00:21:08,614 --> 00:21:09,934
Once you might not even know about that.

385
00:21:09,934 --> 00:21:14,264
OK. Alright. So let me get this straight.
So you're saying that this tournament
is just one big ploy to try and kill me?

386
00:21:14,524 --> 00:21:16,154
I don't know... ah...MAYBE!

387
00:21:16,584 --> 00:21:19,754
Anyway I just think it's dangerous,
and I don't think you should do it!

388
00:21:20,424 --> 00:21:23,034
Alright Hermione, if it means
that much to you...

389
00:21:23,034 --> 00:21:23,964
...I'll drop out.

390
00:21:24,144 --> 00:21:25,494
Oh, thank you Harry!

391
00:21:25,494 --> 00:21:27,234
Wait, wait, what?!?

392
00:21:27,404 --> 00:21:30,854
The house cup? What about all
the eternal glory you'd win?
Come on!

393
00:21:30,944 --> 00:21:32,484
Hey! Eternal glory?

394
00:21:33,154 --> 00:21:34,034
Already got it.

395
00:21:35,374 --> 00:21:37,114
Besides, Neville would be a great
Champion.

396
00:21:37,114 --> 00:21:40,114
No! No! No!
I do not want schlongbottom
to be my champion!

397
00:21:41,524 --> 00:21:42,584
Okay, all you have to do...

398
00:21:42,584 --> 00:21:46,084
Oh, look there's Dumbledore!
Why don't you just talk to him now
and tell him that your dropping out?

399
00:21:46,344 --> 00:21:48,254
Ah... Lis... Listen, Hermoine,

400
00:21:48,634 --> 00:21:51,074
Dumbledore and I are really really cool,
we are super tight,

401
00:21:51,074 --> 00:21:53,684
I don't want him to think I'm being lazy
or disrespectful.

402
00:21:54,074 --> 00:21:57,494
So can you just tell...
why don't you tell him? Just tell him
I want to work on school or something.

403
00:21:57,594 --> 00:22:00,344
Alright? Hey, you got this one, you're the best!

404
00:22:01,434 --> 00:22:02,154
Alright.

405
00:22:02,554 --> 00:22:03,634
Don't worry about it.

406
00:22:04,334 --> 00:22:05,034
Dumbledore?

407
00:22:05,034 --> 00:22:05,964
Yes, Granger?

408
00:22:05,964 --> 00:22:09,904
I need to talk to you for a moment.
It's about the house cup tournament.

409
00:22:10,224 --> 00:22:16,674
Ah, well first of all I think it's an awfull idea,
but second of all I don't think that
Harry Potter should compete.

410
00:22:16,674 --> 00:22:19,304
Granger, why you always gottta be
such an old stick in the mudd?

411
00:22:19,304 --> 00:22:21,654
Pray tell me why Harry Potter
should not compete.

412
00:22:21,654 --> 00:22:24,164
Ah, because he... wants to study!

413
00:22:24,524 --> 00:22:27,094
Granger, nobody studies at Hogwarts
except for you!

414
00:22:27,094 --> 00:22:30,364
Ah... okay, well...
he wants to focus on the OWLs.

415
00:22:30,514 --> 00:22:34,804
Why couldn't Harry have
told me this himself?
He thinks I'm cool.

416
00:22:34,814 --> 00:22:35,984
We're tight!

417
00:22:36,674 --> 00:22:40,584
Profess... I'm a really bad liar, okay...
I think it's a ruse!

418
00:22:40,584 --> 00:22:44,434
A- A set up, and I even think Snape
might be trying to kill Harry Potter!

419
00:22:44,444 --> 00:22:49,134
Severus Snape is one of the kindest,
bravest, gentliest, sexiest men
I have ever met.

420
00:22:51,674 --> 00:22:55,814
Severus Snape is trying to kill Harry Potter
just about as much as he's trying to kill me!

421
00:22:56,624 --> 00:22:58,704
Oh, hi Professor Dumbledore!

422
00:22:59,224 --> 00:23:01,824
I happened to be in the kitchen
and I made you this...

423
00:23:01,984 --> 00:23:03,294
delicious Sandwich.

424
00:23:04,524 --> 00:23:08,684
Why, thank you Severus!
You see, Granger, how thoughtful!

425
00:23:09,504 --> 00:23:11,004
Here you are, Professor.

426
00:23:11,004 --> 00:23:12,514
Bomb apetit, I mean:

427
00:23:12,514 --> 00:23:14,634
Bon apetit...

428
00:23:18,604 --> 00:23:20,904
Ah... Is that sandwich ticking?

429
00:23:20,904 --> 00:23:22,684
It looks like it's licking!

430
00:23:22,684 --> 00:23:24,084
Finger licking good!

431
00:23:25,144 --> 00:23:27,324
Professor, I don't think you should
eat that sandwich!

432
00:23:27,324 --> 00:23:30,604
Why, Granger. Listen a snape more often,
you might even get a sandwich out of that...

433
00:23:31,604 --> 00:23:32,854
Granger, what the hell...

434
00:23:33,084 --> 00:23:34,444
Granger, what are you doing?

435
00:23:34,694 --> 00:23:36,894
You doggone and exploded my sandwich!
It's all going exploding my sandwich!

436
00:23:36,894 --> 00:23:38,184
I'm sorry, Sir!

437
00:23:38,184 --> 00:23:41,734
Hey! Even if I did believe that Harry Potter
was in danger he has to compete!

438
00:23:41,734 --> 00:23:42,584
You see that cup?

439
00:23:42,594 --> 00:23:42,954
Yes.

440
00:23:42,954 --> 00:23:43,984
It's enchanted!

441
00:23:44,144 --> 00:23:47,844
Whosever's name comes out of the cup
has to compete or the results would be bad.

442
00:23:47,974 --> 00:23:48,984
What do you mean bad?

443
00:23:48,984 --> 00:23:56,034
Well, try to imagine your entire life stopping
instantaneously and every molecule in your
body exploding with the speed of light.

444
00:23:56,034 --> 00:23:57,334
Total-protonic-reversall!
[Ghost Busters reference]

445
00:23:57,664 --> 00:24:00,594
Yeah! So you see he has to compete, then...

446
00:24:00,594 --> 00:24:04,284
Hermione, if it makes you feel any better,
the last guy that died in the tournament
was a Hufflepuff

447
00:24:04,284 --> 00:24:05,204
so ahm...

448
00:24:06,124 --> 00:24:10,414
I'll keep my eyes open
you keep these little baby legs open

449
00:24:10,614 --> 00:24:12,000
and nothing's gonna get past old Dumbledore.

450
00:24:13,434 --> 00:24:14,284
Alright.

451
00:24:14,964 --> 00:24:17,114
Now I gotta go make myself another sandwich.

452
00:24:17,114 --> 00:24:19,264
Although I don't know how it's gonna be
as good as the last one.

453
00:24:19,334 --> 00:24:20,874
The last one ticked!

454
00:24:21,464 --> 00:24:23,384
Because it was a bomb...!?!

455
00:24:24,264 --> 00:24:25,864
Harry, I'm so sorry but...

456
00:24:26,214 --> 00:24:28,594
I think you gonna have to compete in the
house cup tournament.

457
00:24:28,594 --> 00:24:32,434
But don't worry, I won't rest until I find out
what the first task is gonna be.

458
00:24:32,434 --> 00:24:35,584
And I'll sabotage all the other Champions,
so you'll win by default.

459
00:24:35,584 --> 00:24:36,954
Alright. Awesome!

460
00:24:40,784 --> 00:24:44,164
Well, Isn't this touching!

461
00:24:44,164 --> 00:24:46,464
Oh my god, just butt out, Malfoy!

462
00:24:51,994 --> 00:24:54,064
Father and I have a bet, you know?

463
00:24:54,654 --> 00:24:57,264
He says you won't last five minutes
in this tournament.

464
00:24:57,924 --> 00:24:59,274
I disagree.

465
00:25:01,584 --> 00:25:05,364
I say you won't last five minutes at Pigfarts!

466
00:25:05,534 --> 00:25:08,234
What? Alright, Malfoy, what...
what is Pigfarts?

467
00:25:08,974 --> 00:25:11,444
Oh, never heard of it?

468
00:25:11,444 --> 00:25:16,394
Ha! Figures, famous Potter doesn't even know
about Pigfarts!

469
00:25:17,904 --> 00:25:22,674
Malfoy, don't act if you don't wanna talk about it.
That's like the ninth time you mentioned Pigfarts!
What is Pigfarts?

470
00:25:23,464 --> 00:25:27,534
Pigfarts is only the greatest
wizardring school in the Galaxy.

471
00:25:27,674 --> 00:25:29,914
That's why I'm being transfered next year.

472
00:25:29,924 --> 00:25:31,264
Malfoy, I've never heard of that.

473
00:25:32,154 --> 00:25:33,854
That's because Pigfarts...

474
00:25:34,804 --> 00:25:36,404
... is on MARS!

475
00:25:37,854 --> 00:25:41,234
Alright. Malfoy, you know we're trying to have
a conversation here so you just leave us alone.

476
00:25:41,234 --> 00:25:42,934
Oh no! I'm not even here!

477
00:25:43,534 --> 00:25:46,364
Anyway, I think we can find out,
what the first task's, when Dumbledore...

478
00:25:46,364 --> 00:25:47,294
DUMBLEDORE???

479
00:25:47,794 --> 00:25:50,944
What an old coot! He's nothing like Rumbleroar!

480
00:25:51,274 --> 00:25:52,714
RUMBLEROAR!!!

481
00:25:53,994 --> 00:25:54,994
Anyway, I was saying...

482
00:25:55,324 --> 00:25:57,794
Rumbleroar is the headmaster of Pigfarts!

483
00:25:58,574 --> 00:26:00,914
He's a lion who can talk.

484
00:26:02,674 --> 00:26:08,494
Malfoy, if you don't mind...
we're trying to have a conversation here it's not like...
you're not even eating, get out of here!

485
00:26:08,494 --> 00:26:12,344
I can't help it if we can hear everything you say,
we're the only ones in here.

486
00:26:12,694 --> 00:26:14,734
Just... Malfoy just get out of here. Please?

487
00:26:15,224 --> 00:26:17,404
Where are we supposed to go???

488
00:26:17,744 --> 00:26:19,784
ah, I don't know..., ah... Pigfarts!

489
00:26:20,714 --> 00:26:23,854
Haha! Now you're just being cute!

490
00:26:24,174 --> 00:26:26,304
I can't GO to Pigfarts!

491
00:26:26,594 --> 00:26:28,674
It's ON MARS!

492
00:26:29,254 --> 00:26:33,254
You need a rocket ship!
Do you have a rocket ship, Potter?

493
00:26:34,084 --> 00:26:41,374
If you do: You know not all of us inherited
enough money to buy out the NASA
when our parents died.

494
00:26:44,204 --> 00:26:45,224
Look at this!

495
00:26:45,224 --> 00:26:49,374
Look at this... it's rocket ship Potter!

496
00:26:49,984 --> 00:26:52,604
Oh! Starkid Potter,

497
00:26:52,604 --> 00:26:54,574
Moon shoes-Potter!

498
00:26:54,574 --> 00:26:58,954
Traversing the galaxy for intergalactic
travels to Pigfarts!

499
00:26:59,954 --> 00:27:01,134
Alright, that's it.

500
00:27:01,134 --> 00:27:03,374
That's the most misguided way to try to
make me feel jealous!

501
00:27:03,374 --> 00:27:05,374
I don't care if you make fun of me,...

502
00:27:05,374 --> 00:27:07,474
...but dragging my parents into this
it's a whole other story!

503
00:27:07,474 --> 00:27:09,534
Woah, not so fast, Potter! Crabbe! Goyle!

504
00:27:09,884 --> 00:27:10,534
Oh shit, just...

505
00:27:11,004 --> 00:27:12,344
Back off, nerd!

506
00:27:12,634 --> 00:27:13,914
I'm scared, I'm scared!!!

507
00:27:14,304 --> 00:27:17,004
Not so tough now, are you Potter?

508
00:27:18,274 --> 00:27:20,164
Maybe you should hang out with someone better...

509
00:27:20,164 --> 00:27:23,454
than that lolly gaging ginger and
his stupid mud-blood girlfriend!

510
00:27:23,454 --> 00:27:27,224
Oh! That is it, Malfoy! Jelly-legs-jinx!

511
00:27:27,224 --> 00:27:27,974
Oh come on!

512
00:27:28,184 --> 00:27:30,674
Hey, it's not fair, our legs are jelly!

513
00:27:32,664 --> 00:27:34,064
Take it back, Malfoy!

514
00:27:34,064 --> 00:27:35,024
Take what back?

515
00:27:35,024 --> 00:27:37,724
Take back what you said about your stupid
made-up space-school!

516
00:27:37,724 --> 00:27:41,014
Yeah and all that stuff about Hermione
being my girlfriend. That's not even a little bit true.

517
00:27:42,674 --> 00:27:45,104
And say you're sorry for calling me a you-know-what!

518
00:27:45,464 --> 00:27:46,124
I'm sorry!

519
00:27:46,124 --> 00:27:47,704
And you promise you'll never do it again?

520
00:27:47,704 --> 00:27:48,784
I promise!

521
00:27:48,784 --> 00:27:49,544
Right!

522
00:27:49,884 --> 00:27:52,904
Now, next time we tell you to leave us alone,
you better do it!

523
00:27:53,624 --> 00:27:55,644
Come on Harry, Ron, lets get out of here!

524
00:27:55,644 --> 00:27:58,014
Besides, you already ate all my lunch!

525
00:27:58,274 --> 00:27:59,484
Oh! Thanks, Hermione.

526
00:27:59,484 --> 00:28:00,954
Yeah. Unjellify!

527
00:28:02,794 --> 00:28:04,804
That was the most bad-ass-thing I've ever seen.

528
00:28:04,804 --> 00:28:09,784
Too bad no one was here to see it.
It was like an outburst of pent up aggression.
It was like ARRRGH Hermione

529
00:28:12,294 --> 00:28:16,614
Wow! That sucked, royal Hippogriff!

530
00:28:17,264 --> 00:28:20,564
We got beat by a girl. Who is a nerd!

531
00:28:22,524 --> 00:28:24,574
I didn't mean what I said, you know?

532
00:28:25,114 --> 00:28:26,654
Pigfarts is real!

533
00:28:28,124 --> 00:28:30,154
Am I... am I bleeding?

534
00:28:32,444 --> 00:28:33,214
Goyle?

535
00:28:36,424 --> 00:28:37,234
No!

536
00:28:39,604 --> 00:28:41,264
I thought maybe....

537
00:28:41,634 --> 00:28:43,194
maybe it was a little bit...

538
00:28:47,704 --> 00:28:51,454
Woah! Never been pushed down like that by a girl!

539
00:28:52,464 --> 00:28:54,534
Maybe I shouldn't call her a mud...

540
00:28:55,994 --> 00:28:56,674
Whatever!

541
00:28:58,774 --> 00:29:03,134
I can't believe I couldn't figure out
the counter curse was just unjellify!

542
00:29:04,834 --> 00:29:05,784
Right.

543
00:29:06,384 --> 00:29:07,624
I'm not surprised.

544
00:29:07,974 --> 00:29:10,384
Come on, let's go watch 'Wizard's of waverly place".

545
00:29:17,780 --> 00:29:20,220
Fools! They're all fools.

546
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:22,030
They think they're safe.

547
00:29:22,330 --> 00:29:26,600
They think they're back for another fun
year of learning shenanigans at Hogwarts.

548
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:31,060
Little do they know the danger that's
lurking right under their noses.

549
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:36,140
Or should I say: on the back of their heads?

550
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:49,290
Oh, I can't breathe in that damn turban!

551
00:29:49,430 --> 00:29:52,150
I'm sorry my Lord. It's a necessary precaution.

552
00:29:52,410 --> 00:29:54,110
For if they knew that you lived...

553
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:56,790
And when Harry Potter destroyed you,
your soul lived on...

554
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:02,110
Yes, that when my body was destroyed,
I was forced to live in the forbidden forest.

555
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:04,980
Eating bugs and mushrooms and, ugh!

556
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:06,370
Unicornblood

557
00:30:06,370 --> 00:30:09,330
Until I found you and let you
attach yourself to my soul.

558
00:30:09,470 --> 00:30:12,110
Yes. Nobody must know any of that.

559
00:30:12,850 --> 00:30:17,910
Now, Quirrel... get me some water!

560
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:24,180
Now Quirrell...

561
00:30:24,610 --> 00:30:26,060
Pour it in my mouth!

562
00:30:39,310 --> 00:30:44,030
Your plan to infiltrate Hogwarts on the
back of my head is going swimmingly, my liege!

563
00:30:44,210 --> 00:30:46,070
Yes, yes, yes! I'm done with the water!

564
00:30:53,350 --> 00:30:56,800
We must not have any more foul-up's
like tonight in the great hall.

565
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:58,910
I'm sorry, my lord. You sneezed.

566
00:30:58,910 --> 00:31:00,110
I know that!

567
00:31:01,130 --> 00:31:03,480
Get me some nasonex, you swine.

568
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:15,630
Wash that turban!

569
00:31:15,770 --> 00:31:17,330
Tickles my nose.

570
00:31:17,620 --> 00:31:19,030
Yes, my dark king.

571
00:31:19,030 --> 00:31:22,680
Okay, just... relax with the dark king.
Okay?

572
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:25,520
I watch you wipe your butt daily.

573
00:31:26,130 --> 00:31:28,730
You can call me Voldemort, we're there.

574
00:31:29,540 --> 00:31:31,430
We've reached that point.

575
00:31:33,150 --> 00:31:37,470
Yes... yes. Yes, my... Voldemort.

576
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:39,850
Now Quirrell:

577
00:31:40,820 --> 00:31:42,460
Get us ready for bed!

578
00:31:43,530 --> 00:31:47,480
We must be well rested, if we wish to kill Potter.

579
00:31:48,750 --> 00:31:54,150
Tonight in the great hall - he was so close.
I could have touched him!

580
00:31:54,650 --> 00:31:57,160
Revenge is at my fingertips, Quirrell.

581
00:31:57,380 --> 00:31:58,590
I can taste it!

582
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:00,450
It tastes like...

583
00:32:00,650 --> 00:32:01,670
Coolmints!

584
00:32:01,820 --> 00:32:04,020
Bedtime is to ring, Voldemort.

585
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:06,360
Yes, excellent.

586
00:32:07,580 --> 00:32:10,790
Well, ah... good night, Quirrell.

587
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,070
Good night.

588
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:28,830
Okay, okay, I can't do this!

589
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:32,190
You gotta roll over. I can't sleep on my tummy.

590
00:32:32,830 --> 00:32:37,190
I always sleep on my back. I have backtroubles,
it's the only way I'm comfortable.

591
00:32:37,190 --> 00:32:39,930
You roll over right now, or I'll...

592
00:32:40,060 --> 00:32:41,440
eat your pillow!

593
00:32:41,580 --> 00:32:44,140
You'll having a dream that you're
eating a giant marshmallow...

594
00:32:44,140 --> 00:32:48,080
but really you'll wake up, and your favorite
goose feather pillow will be missing!

595
00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:52,290
Fine, we'll compromise. We sleep on our side.

596
00:32:52,620 --> 00:32:54,850
Okay, I guess I can do this.

597
00:32:55,020 --> 00:32:56,450
Now, good night!

598
00:32:57,460 --> 00:32:58,790
Good night, Quirrell.

599
00:33:08,970 --> 00:33:10,670
Hey, Quirrell...

600
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:14,590
...how long have those robes
been on that chair?

601
00:33:15,260 --> 00:33:18,610
I think they're from last night.
I just put them there for now.

602
00:33:20,260 --> 00:33:23,780
Ah... you planing on putting them
in a hamper? What's your plan
for these?

603
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:29,040
I'm thinking I just leaving them there
for now and maybe put them away
in the morning, okay?

604
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:31,750
Ugh! ..No! No!

605
00:33:32,190 --> 00:33:36,840
No, that's not okay!
I can't go to sleep knowing that there
are dirty clothes on that chair.

606
00:33:37,290 --> 00:33:39,340
The chair is going to start to
smell like dirty clothes!

607
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:42,140
Look, I promised I'll put them away
in the morning.

608
00:33:42,410 --> 00:33:45,330
You put them away RIGHT NOW!

609
00:33:45,730 --> 00:33:48,350
I command you to get up and...

610
00:33:48,420 --> 00:33:50,190
fold them at least!

611
00:33:50,660 --> 00:33:52,260
Make it into a neat pile!

612
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:59,000
Look, if we're going to be in this situation
for a while, we're going to have to learn
to live with each other.

613
00:33:59,310 --> 00:34:02,590
Now, I've been single for all of my life
and I have some habits.

614
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:04,970
And sometime, I leave laundry around.

615
00:34:05,110 --> 00:34:07,710
Well, I believe, that everything has it's place.

616
00:34:08,210 --> 00:34:10,340
Muggles have their place.

617
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:13,100
Mudbloods have their place.

618
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:15,840
And so do your clothes!

619
00:34:15,990 --> 00:34:17,500
Namely: a dresser!

620
00:34:18,010 --> 00:34:20,590
Well, aren't we an odd couple?

621
00:34:23,390 --> 00:34:25,430
You won't sleep on your tummy

622
00:34:25,890 --> 00:34:27,900
You won't sleep on your back

623
00:34:28,230 --> 00:34:31,960
We're quite a kooky couple you'll agree

624
00:34:32,850 --> 00:34:35,540
We share some hands and fingers

625
00:34:36,010 --> 00:34:39,510
And yet the feeling lingers

626
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:47,940
We're just about as different as anyone can be

627
00:34:49,590 --> 00:34:55,630
You like plotting a garden and I like plotting to kill

628
00:34:56,120 --> 00:35:01,410
You think that you should rule the world,
I think books are a thrill

629
00:35:01,850 --> 00:35:04,600
Sipping tea by the fire is swell

630
00:35:04,860 --> 00:35:07,400
Pushing people in is fun as well

631
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:10,210
I like folding all my ties

632
00:35:10,210 --> 00:35:12,970
And you have no friends,
hey that's a surprise

633
00:35:13,510 --> 00:35:17,940
I guess its plain to see 
when you look at you and me

634
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:21,940
We're different
different
as can be

635
00:35:23,980 --> 00:35:26,660
You're a sissy, a twat, a girl!

636
00:35:26,790 --> 00:35:29,210
I'm the darkest of lords!

637
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:32,070
I'm the brightest professor here

638
00:35:32,270 --> 00:35:34,540
I've won several awards

639
00:35:34,820 --> 00:35:37,570
My new world is about to unfold

640
00:35:37,710 --> 00:35:39,880
You got beat by a two year

641
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:42,610
I'll kill him this time through and through

642
00:35:42,980 --> 00:35:45,200
Or you might just give him another tattoo

643
00:35:45,550 --> 00:35:49,900
You really must agree 
when you look at you and me

644
00:35:50,250 --> 00:35:53,200
we're different
different
as can-

645
00:35:53,610 --> 00:35:58,440
I'll rise again and I'll rule the world

646
00:35:58,670 --> 00:36:03,210
But you must help me renew

647
00:36:04,210 --> 00:36:06,380
For when our plan succeeds

648
00:36:06,390 --> 00:36:07,310
Prevails!

649
00:36:07,530 --> 00:36:10,510
Part of that world goes to you

650
00:36:10,660 --> 00:36:14,960
When I rule the world I'll plant flowers

651
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:20,030
When I rule the world I'll have snakes

652
00:36:20,470 --> 00:36:28,110
- And Jane Austin novels
- And goblins, and werewolves,
a fleet of dementors, and giants,
and Thestrals, and all my Death Eaters!

653
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:35,440
When I rule the world!!

654
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:43,580
Hahaha!

655
00:36:49,817 --> 00:36:53,287
Harry, don't you think you should try and
figure out what the first task is gonna be?

656
00:36:53,287 --> 00:36:55,667
You could actually die if you're not ready.

657
00:36:56,497 --> 00:36:57,567
What?!?

658
00:36:58,017 --> 00:36:59,127
Come on!

659
00:37:00,437 --> 00:37:02,127
I mean: Can't you just do it for me?

660
00:37:02,127 --> 00:37:04,977
Can't you just prepair all my stuff for me?
What are you doing right now?

661
00:37:04,987 --> 00:37:06,537
I'm writing your potions-assay.

662
00:37:07,297 --> 00:37:09,447
Oh, well do that first because
that's due tomorrow.

663
00:37:10,487 --> 00:37:13,547
But after that... after that can you
prepare for the first task, please?

664
00:37:13,547 --> 00:37:15,617
Thank you! You are the BEST!
Yeah.

665
00:37:16,027 --> 00:37:17,627
You got it.  Thanks Hermoine.

666
00:37:21,077 --> 00:37:23,477
Hey Ginny, come here! I wanna show
you something, come here.

667
00:37:24,347 --> 00:37:26,057
Hey, Harry Potter!

668
00:37:28,197 --> 00:37:32,237
Listen, I wanna play this song
that I'm working on.
I met this girl I really really like.

669
00:37:32,477 --> 00:37:34,217
I wanna let her know that she's
really special.

670
00:37:34,497 --> 00:37:36,607
So I just wanna know what you think.

671
00:37:36,607 --> 00:37:41,437
Just for the purpose's of now because
I'm still working on the lyrics. I'm putting
your name where her name should be.

672
00:37:41,437 --> 00:37:45,817
But I don't think it's really gonna work out,
because... well, the music'll show.

673
00:37:47,157 --> 00:37:50,287
You're tall and fun and pretty,
you're really really skinny...

674
00:37:50,287 --> 00:37:52,317
Ginny!?!

675
00:37:52,847 --> 00:37:56,567
I'm the Micky to your Minnie,
your the Tigger to my Winnie,...

676
00:37:57,267 --> 00:37:58,497
Ginny!

677
00:37:58,827 --> 00:38:04,107
I wanna take you to the city,
gonna take you out to dinny.
Ginny!

678
00:38:04,987 --> 00:38:07,337
You're cuter then a guinea pig,

679
00:38:07,757 --> 00:38:09,687
Wanna take you up to Winnipeg.

680
00:38:09,687 --> 00:38:11,507
That's in Canada!

681
00:38:13,157 --> 00:38:14,437
Ginny, Ginny, Ginny---

682
00:38:14,437 --> 00:38:15,437
You know what? This isn't working
for me... at all. It doesn't work.

683
00:38:15,437 --> 00:38:21,257
But I don't know:
How does it make you feel?
Emotionally?

684
00:38:21,577 --> 00:38:22,807
Wow!

685
00:38:23,357 --> 00:38:26,307
Wowy! Harry Potter!

686
00:38:26,307 --> 00:38:27,667
Don't you think it could...ah...
I don't know...

687
00:38:28,007 --> 00:38:29,317
... make a girl fall in love with me?

688
00:38:30,127 --> 00:38:31,797
Oh, I think it already has...

689
00:38:32,727 --> 00:38:34,637
Awesome! 'cause it's for Cho Chang!

690
00:38:36,757 --> 00:38:40,027
Oh yeah...She, she's beautiful...

691
00:38:40,327 --> 00:38:41,357
What, are you nuts?

692
00:38:41,357 --> 00:38:44,267
Beautiful!?! More like
Super-mega-foxy-awesome-hot!

693
00:38:44,557 --> 00:38:46,357
She's the hottest girl I've ever met.

694
00:38:46,367 --> 00:38:47,677
She's far more attractive,

695
00:38:47,677 --> 00:38:48,607
far more appealing,

696
00:38:48,607 --> 00:38:50,807
far more interesting than any girl that I know.

697
00:38:50,807 --> 00:38:52,507
In my immediate group of...of friends.

698
00:38:53,227 --> 00:38:55,557
She is much m.. more better and awesome.

699
00:38:56,800 --> 00:39:02,557
And if this song is as awesome as i know it is
Then she's gonna have to make some room in those robes of hers

700
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:06,557
You get what i'm saying?
It's an innuendo!

701
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:11,557
I wanna have sex with her

702
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:20,557
At least get natured

703
00:39:28,127 --> 00:39:28,847
Hi Neville!

704
00:39:29,987 --> 00:39:32,837
Move, move, move, move,...

705
00:39:33,317 --> 00:39:34,887
Awesome. 
Hey Harry, what's up?

706
00:39:34,887 --> 00:39:36,827
So, I was just off stage hanging out with Hagrid,

707
00:39:36,987 --> 00:39:39,547
and I was... ah,I saw these delivery-wizards,

708
00:39:39,707 --> 00:39:43,747
bringing giant cages into the dungeons,
I don't know, what that's for...

709
00:39:43,757 --> 00:39:45,227
Giant cages?

710
00:39:45,867 --> 00:39:48,587
I bet whatever is in those cages
has something to do with the first task!

711
00:39:48,707 --> 00:39:50,167
Harry, we have to find out what it is!

712
00:39:50,647 --> 00:39:52,767
Hey! Hey, guys!

713
00:39:52,767 --> 00:39:53,457
Chill!

714
00:39:53,457 --> 00:39:54,737
I'm busy!

715
00:39:58,887 --> 00:40:03,877
No no no no no no no!

716
00:40:07,037 --> 00:40:10,777
Guys, now listen:
This could be a matter of life and death!

717
00:40:10,777 --> 00:40:13,457
What does it matter,
because it's after hours, okay?

718
00:40:13,457 --> 00:40:17,067
So, we can't leave Gryffindor house,
We'll probably get in trouble if we do.

719
00:40:17,087 --> 00:40:18,237
and even if we do...

720
00:40:18,237 --> 00:40:20,407
schlongbottom over there
will probably tell on us.

721
00:40:20,407 --> 00:40:21,597
Neville won't tell!

722
00:40:21,597 --> 00:40:23,197
Oh, yes! I certainly will!

723
00:40:24,627 --> 00:40:26,437
Damn. What are we gonna do?

724
00:40:27,007 --> 00:40:29,237
It's simple guys: The cloak!

725
00:40:29,547 --> 00:40:30,337
Of course!

726
00:40:30,947 --> 00:40:32,097
The cloak!

727
00:40:33,147 --> 00:40:34,577
Wait, what cloak?

728
00:40:34,577 --> 00:40:35,447
Shut up!

729
00:40:36,407 --> 00:40:37,277
In my first year at Hogwarts

730
00:40:37,537 --> 00:40:41,707
...I got a... I got a present last year...
oh, bye Neville!

731
00:40:41,707 --> 00:40:45,327
I got a present last year.
First year at Hogwarts. And, ah,...

732
00:40:45,327 --> 00:40:49,327
That cloak... 
It was left to me by my dad.
My dad is dead, my father is dead.

733
00:40:49,327 --> 00:40:51,257
I have a dead father...

734
00:40:52,597 --> 00:40:55,197
This is ah... This is some good stuff.
My invisibility-cloak!

735
00:40:56,457 --> 00:40:57,757
Oh wow!

736
00:40:57,757 --> 00:41:01,067
Oh boy, wowy, Harry Potter!

737
00:41:02,307 --> 00:41:03,767
You have an invisibility-cloak!

738
00:41:03,777 --> 00:41:07,677
Oh! Oh! Oh! Do you know what I
would do if I had an invisibility-cloak?

739
00:41:07,677 --> 00:41:10,157
I would...ah... I would kick weiner dogs.

740
00:41:10,277 --> 00:41:12,777
I would pretend to be a ghost,
and I would scare mean people.

741
00:41:13,567 --> 00:41:16,697
I'd use it to avoid ever having to
face my reflexion in the mirror.

742
00:41:22,207 --> 00:41:28,107
Well, actually I was gonna to say, that
I would use it to fake my own death
and watch people cry at the funeral.

743
00:41:28,107 --> 00:41:31,907
Okay, anyway, let's get outta here before
Neville comes back from the bathroom,
let's get outta here.

744
00:41:31,907 --> 00:41:34,887
Wow wow wow wow wow,
where do you think you're going?

745
00:41:35,067 --> 00:41:36,327
With you guys...?

746
00:41:36,327 --> 00:41:38,937
No, no! No way!
No kid sisters allowed, okay?

747
00:41:41,187 --> 00:41:45,437
Besides, there's only enough room
under this cloak for two people, so ah...

748
00:41:46,167 --> 00:41:47,437
Come on, Hermione! Come on...

749
00:41:55,507 --> 00:41:59,427
The way his hair falls in his eyes

750
00:41:59,427 --> 00:42:02,347
makes me wonder if he'll

751
00:42:02,657 --> 00:42:05,977
ever see through my disguise

752
00:42:06,137 --> 00:42:08,747
and I'm under his spell

753
00:42:09,027 --> 00:42:14,057
everything is falling
and I don't know where to land

754
00:42:14,327 --> 00:42:20,667
everyone knows who he is
but they don't know who I am

755
00:42:23,737 --> 00:42:27,707
Harry

756
00:42:29,927 --> 00:42:34,557
Harry

757
00:42:36,427 --> 00:42:41,117
Why can't you see

758
00:42:43,127 --> 00:42:47,587
what you're doing to me?

759
00:42:49,377 --> 00:42:52,477
I've seen you conquer certain death

760
00:42:53,287 --> 00:42:59,477
and even when you're just standing there
you take away my breath

761
00:43:00,567 --> 00:43:04,297
and maybe, someday you'll hear my song

762
00:43:04,297 --> 00:43:07,657
and understand that all along

763
00:43:07,657 --> 00:43:15,257
there's something more that I'm trying to say

764
00:43:15,767 --> 00:43:17,097
when I say

765
00:43:17,517 --> 00:43:21,147
Harry

766
00:43:23,717 --> 00:43:27,767
Harry

767
00:43:29,787 --> 00:43:34,187
Why can't you see

768
00:43:36,297 --> 00:43:41,727
what you're doing to me?

769
00:43:44,547 --> 00:43:52,067
what you're doing to me?

770
00:43:53,250 --> 00:43:57,440
Master! Master!The shipments
for the first task of the tournament
have just arrived!

771
00:43:57,440 --> 00:43:58,670
Yes, I know, Quirrell.

772
00:43:58,670 --> 00:44:01,330
I hear everything that you hear.

773
00:44:03,160 --> 00:44:04,800
Isn't it wonderful, master?

774
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:08,730
We've made sure, that Harry Potters
Name was drawn from the cup
and soon he will be ours.

775
00:44:08,730 --> 00:44:10,260
Yeees!

776
00:44:10,650 --> 00:44:12,580
It's really happening, isn't it, Quirrell?

777
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:19,310
You know, with the plan going so well,
I feel like maybe we should celebrate.

778
00:44:19,540 --> 00:44:20,830
What do you say, Quirrell?

779
00:44:20,830 --> 00:44:22,310
How's about we go out?

780
00:44:22,990 --> 00:44:25,550
I hear it's Karaoke-night
down at the Hogshead.

781
00:44:27,170 --> 00:44:28,030
I don't know.

782
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:34,080
I've all these papers to grade and
I've been giving so much attention to this
revenge plan that I'm really behind.

783
00:44:34,080 --> 00:44:35,950
Ah, come on, Quirrel!

784
00:44:36,220 --> 00:44:40,130
You've been working so hard all year!
You deserve a night off!

785
00:44:40,410 --> 00:44:41,590
But the papers!

786
00:44:41,590 --> 00:44:44,500
Oh, just give them all B Minuses
and be done with it!

787
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:46,710
Now, that's evil!

788
00:44:46,710 --> 00:44:49,380
Ha, yeah thanks! I am the dark Lord!

789
00:44:51,050 --> 00:44:54,210
Come on! Just a few drinks...

790
00:44:54,580 --> 00:44:56,590
And we'll try to pick up some chicks.

791
00:44:56,980 --> 00:44:59,540
I wouldn't know what to say.
I'm no good at that.

792
00:44:59,540 --> 00:45:02,800
Come on, it will be fun!
You'll just move your lips
and I'll do the talking.

793
00:45:03,300 --> 00:45:04,580
Aaaaahm...

794
00:45:04,760 --> 00:45:06,020
Quirrell!!!

795
00:45:06,630 --> 00:45:07,720
Man!

796
00:45:08,190 --> 00:45:10,110
Listen!

797
00:45:11,250 --> 00:45:13,800
I may just be a parasite
on the back of your head,

798
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:15,930
literally devouring your soul,

799
00:45:15,930 --> 00:45:17,370
every time you take a breath,

800
00:45:17,720 --> 00:45:23,850
but I can see, that your're too good a guy,
not to have a bit of fun once in a while!

801
00:45:24,710 --> 00:45:26,370
You deserve this!

802
00:45:27,390 --> 00:45:29,210
Well, if you put it that way, then...

803
00:45:29,230 --> 00:45:30,790
Yeah! Let's just go wild tonight!

804
00:45:30,790 --> 00:45:33,100
Haaaaa! That's the spirit, Quirrell!

805
00:45:34,300 --> 00:45:37,910
Put on a fresh pair of wizard-shorts
and grab your tunic!

806
00:45:38,380 --> 00:45:40,790
Quirrell, we are gonna get you laid!

807
00:45:42,710 --> 00:45:45,510
Seriously man,
back, when I had a body...

808
00:45:45,530 --> 00:45:48,380
Wuh!...I had mad game with the bitches!

809
00:45:50,300 --> 00:45:52,300
Just ask Bellatrix Lestrange!

810
00:45:55,300 --> 00:45:58,500
Oh ho ho, she is a freak in the sack!!!

811
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:13,080
Wow ah...
this cloak isn't as big as it used to be.

812
00:46:13,180 --> 00:46:17,000
Yeah, I remember this used to be a lot cuter,
but now we just keep bumping into each other.

813
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:21,880
Well if Hermione would take those pillows of my back
Why did you bring those, you ha... you plan on taking a nap?

814
00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:25,880
What pillows?
Yeah Ron and your wand keeps poking me in my
my lower back

815
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:33,880
It's really uncomfortable
All right, no no maybe, maybe 
maybe we should shift positions

816
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:41,880
Here Ron, you get behind me.
NO no no no, I'm not not
not gonna ever get behind you.

817
00:46:42,200 --> 00:46:45,880
Ehm. Just let.. just help me take off 
the cloak right away, ok?

818
00:46:45,900 --> 00:46:47,880
Shhh! Someone's coming!
It's not me i swear

819
00:47:02,110 --> 00:47:03,400
Did you just hear something?

820
00:47:03,690 --> 00:47:06,470
No. Only quiet.

821
00:47:08,290 --> 00:47:10,950
Maybe...one...raindrop.

822
00:47:13,290 --> 00:47:14,950
I think i heard a double entrende.

823
00:47:18,790 --> 00:47:19,780
It's no matter.

824
00:47:20,620 --> 00:47:22,000
Tell me, Goyle:

825
00:47:23,140 --> 00:47:25,720
Who, do you think,
is the ugliest girl in school?

826
00:47:26,110 --> 00:47:28,310
Ah...?

827
00:47:28,320 --> 00:47:30,220
Oh! Buckbeak! For sure.

828
00:47:33,690 --> 00:47:34,450
Crabbe?

829
00:47:34,450 --> 00:47:36,260
Ahh, Winky, the House elf!

830
00:47:37,310 --> 00:47:38,360
Good one!

831
00:47:39,510 --> 00:47:40,700
Yeah!

832
00:47:43,480 --> 00:47:46,300
Do you know who I think
the ugliest girl in school is?

833
00:47:47,460 --> 00:47:49,380
That Hermoine Granger.

834
00:47:50,380 --> 00:47:53,480
Do you know, what I'd give her
on a scale of one to ten,

835
00:47:53,480 --> 00:47:57,920
with one... one would be the ugliest
and then ten is beauty?

836
00:47:58,300 --> 00:47:59,890
I would give her:

837
00:48:01,080 --> 00:48:02,310
an eight!

838
00:48:10,410 --> 00:48:11,820
An eight point five!

839
00:48:12,990 --> 00:48:13,800
Or a nine.

840
00:48:14,700 --> 00:48:17,480
NOT, not over a nine point eight!

841
00:48:19,670 --> 00:48:22,180
Because there's always
room for improvement.

842
00:48:23,060 --> 00:48:25,280
Not everyone's perfect, like me!

843
00:48:25,990 --> 00:48:28,130
That's why I'm holding up for a ten!

844
00:48:29,220 --> 00:48:31,030
Because I'm worth it!

845
00:48:33,780 --> 00:48:35,040
Come on, let's go.

846
00:48:41,240 --> 00:48:42,960
Wow, what a bunch of jerks!

847
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:43,670
Alright, forget them.

848
00:48:43,670 --> 00:48:46,310
Now where did you say you saw
those creates being delivered?

849
00:48:46,310 --> 00:48:50,720
Well, I think they were being delivered
to the auditorium, so they should be at
the end of this hallway and to the left.

850
00:48:57,650 --> 00:48:58,410
Look!

851
00:48:58,410 --> 00:48:59,600
A goat?

852
00:48:59,600 --> 00:49:00,880
A goat? Oh my god,

853
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:03,110
I've to fight a goat.
I don't know if I can do that morally...

854
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:07,110
I'm gonna kill that goat!

855
00:49:07,380 --> 00:49:10,110
Shhh. Someone's comming again.
Ok you got me this time.

856
00:49:12,980 --> 00:49:16,940
And the goats have all been send for
feeding-time, headmaster?

857
00:49:17,220 --> 00:49:17,880
Feeding-time?

858
00:49:17,880 --> 00:49:20,460
Dragons don't wanna be fed,
they wanna hunt!
[Jurassic Park]

859
00:49:20,460 --> 00:49:21,700
Did he just say DRAGONS?

860
00:49:21,710 --> 00:49:23,750
Did you just say:
Did he just say DRAGONS?

861
00:49:24,670 --> 00:49:30,050
I must have, because anybody else
hiding in this room would have known
to have shut up.

862
00:49:30,270 --> 00:49:30,930
Potter!?!

863
00:49:32,420 --> 00:49:36,250
Headmaster, do you really think it's wise
to have children fight dragons?

864
00:49:36,560 --> 00:49:38,700
No Snape, I don't think it's wise to do
anything anymore.

865
00:49:38,700 --> 00:49:42,960
Like, here I am alive and well today and
I could very well be killed by you tomorrow.

866
00:49:44,190 --> 00:49:45,560
Well, that's absurd!

867
00:49:47,370 --> 00:49:49,660
Severus, let's go to bed.

868
00:49:50,060 --> 00:49:51,840
Have you ever seen my room?

869
00:49:51,910 --> 00:49:54,070
I've got some pretty kickin' Posters
on my wall...

870
00:49:57,750 --> 00:49:59,500
Well, I am rather tired.

871
00:50:02,890 --> 00:50:05,530
Oh man, i have to fight a dragon, this is bogus!

872
00:50:06,080 --> 00:50:08,200
How can I fight a dragon?
I'm just a little kid!

873
00:50:08,200 --> 00:50:10,400
Well, maybe it won't be that bad, Harry.

874
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:13,460
Maybe, maybe you'll just have to fight
like Mushu from Mulan.

875
00:50:15,770 --> 00:50:19,280
I don't know, maybe like
Puff the magic dragon or so...

876
00:50:20,090 --> 00:50:22,990
Ron, this is serious, okay?
Harry could die!

877
00:50:23,170 --> 00:50:26,350
Now look there's still the time alright?
If we just can figure out a plan.

878
00:50:26,500 --> 00:50:30,320
Okay. well, we should probably do that back
in the common room. Where's... Wait,
where's the invisibility cloak?

879
00:50:30,320 --> 00:50:33,430
well, I threw it over on that magical
walking chair over th... Oh, crap!

880
00:50:33,430 --> 00:50:35,380
Oh! That's... That's gonna be an issue...

881
00:50:47,435 --> 00:50:49,795
I thought walking home drunk
was hard before...

882
00:50:51,565 --> 00:50:58,205
We should have realized, that...
that with both of us drinking into one belly
we'd get twice as drunk!

883
00:51:02,115 --> 00:51:03,525
Hey Quirrel!

884
00:51:04,955 --> 00:51:10,205
Quirrel, Quirrel... Quirrel... Quirrel
QQQQQQUUUUUIIIIRRRRRRRRRREEEELLLL!

885
00:51:10,685 --> 00:51:12,765
You remember the girl you were talking to?

886
00:51:13,235 --> 00:51:13,955
Yeah.

887
00:51:14,825 --> 00:51:18,665
I was talking to her sister on MY side...

888
00:51:19,565 --> 00:51:22,675
Oh, so that's why she freaked out
when we stood up!

889
00:51:22,795 --> 00:51:26,975
I guess they didn't know that
we were just one/the same person!!!

890
00:51:34,245 --> 00:51:40,825
You know I haven't had... I haven't had 
this much fun since the nearly headless Nicks
d... Nicks deathday party of '91.

891
00:51:42,105 --> 00:51:44,205
I haven't had this much fun since ah...

892
00:51:44,515 --> 00:51:47,785
yeah, well shit, I can't remember
I ever had any such fun...

893
00:51:50,215 --> 00:51:54,825
You never have fun... ever?
Doing...doing anything?

894
00:51:55,585 --> 00:51:57,305
Maybe that's why you're so evil...

895
00:51:58,135 --> 00:51:59,435
Yeah, "MAYBE".

896
00:52:01,285 --> 00:52:07,115
definitely due to the fact that muggles and
mud-bloods make me sick to my stomach,
but ah...

897
00:52:08,595 --> 00:52:14,435
Yeah, I guess you could be right....
I guess...That's kind of funny...

898
00:52:18,255 --> 00:52:19,895
What is it, Voldemort?

899
00:52:19,895 --> 00:52:26,125
Oh, it's just that I never...
I never ever really ever...
I never really ever ever... really ever...

900
00:52:26,125 --> 00:52:31,415
... considered another reason for me being so evil,
you know, 'cuz normally I just, ah...

901
00:52:32,325 --> 00:52:35,615
...I just kill people that try to get me to open up,
you know?

902
00:52:38,215 --> 00:52:39,075
OOPS!

903
00:52:40,995 --> 00:52:43,885
But it's... it's kind of nice to just, ah...

904
00:52:44,235 --> 00:52:45,725
kind of nice to just talk.

905
00:52:46,075 --> 00:52:46,695
Yeah...

906
00:52:47,455 --> 00:52:48,905
You know, I have to admit,

907
00:52:49,225 --> 00:52:52,885
I was kind of nervous, when you first demanded,
that you attach yourself to my soul.

908
00:52:53,115 --> 00:52:55,275
Yeah, I c... I could sense that...

909
00:52:56,095 --> 00:52:59,835
Well, like now I think it's... it's kind of cool!

910
00:53:00,035 --> 00:53:02,745
It's like having a really close roommate,
or... or even...

911
00:53:03,075 --> 00:53:04,635
Yeah, like a slave!

912
00:53:06,145 --> 00:53:07,875
Like a... like a deatheater!

913
00:53:09,795 --> 00:53:11,545
No man... It's like...

914
00:53:11,815 --> 00:53:13,245
having a friend!

915
00:53:22,645 --> 00:53:24,795
I've never had a friend before...

916
00:53:26,115 --> 00:53:28,015
Well, looks like you've got one now!

917
00:53:35,375 --> 00:53:40,465
Who would have thought that at the beginning
of this year, we'd feel like that for each other!

918
00:53:41,865 --> 00:53:44,975
I guess everything is different
between us now, ah?

919
00:53:47,065 --> 00:53:49,615
I guess it's plain to see,

920
00:53:50,285 --> 00:53:54,215
when you look at you and me:

921
00:53:55,135 --> 00:53:57,035
We're different,

922
00:53:57,735 --> 00:53:58,835
different

923
00:53:58,955 --> 00:54:00,755
as can be.

924
00:54:03,985 --> 00:54:06,335
We simply guarantee,

925
00:54:06,545 --> 00:54:09,525
when you look at you and me:

926
00:54:09,735 --> 00:54:15,235
we're different, different as can be.

927
00:54:16,835 --> 00:54:18,875
It's a comedy of sorts,

928
00:54:19,275 --> 00:54:23,065
when you're bound to Voldemort!

929
00:54:24,295 --> 00:54:27,665
And I'm happy as a squirrell,

930
00:54:28,505 --> 00:54:32,875
Long as I'm with Mr. Quirrell!

931
00:54:34,715 --> 00:54:41,185
We'll lead 'em to the slaughter and we'll murder
Harry Potter, we're different

932
00:54:41,635 --> 00:54:44,035
different,

933
00:54:44,305 --> 00:54:49,005
different, different as can...

934
00:54:58,358 --> 00:55:02,038
The Hogwarts champions shall now
enter the champions tend,

935
00:55:02,268 --> 00:55:05,358
in preparation for the first task!

936
00:55:08,558 --> 00:55:12,328
Oh, man I can't believe I've gotta skip
lunch period for this stupid task.

937
00:55:12,338 --> 00:55:14,328
Okay, Harry. Today is the day!

938
00:55:14,628 --> 00:55:15,438
The day you fight the dragon.

939
00:55:15,608 --> 00:55:17,808
Now, did you read those notes that I
wrote for you on dragons?

940
00:55:18,118 --> 00:55:18,798
No.

941
00:55:19,498 --> 00:55:20,508
What? Why not?

942
00:55:20,508 --> 00:55:21,908
Are you kidding me? That's so boring!

943
00:55:23,198 --> 00:55:26,768
So you... you didn't read them?
You didn't prepare at all?
You're not prepared at all?

944
00:55:26,928 --> 00:55:28,738
Well, no. But at least
I have my wand...

945
00:55:29,408 --> 00:55:30,288
...ahm...

946
00:55:31,178 --> 00:55:31,998
I dropped my...

947
00:55:32,198 --> 00:55:33,048
Here!

948
00:55:33,498 --> 00:55:37,698
Hey! Cool! You're the best!

949
00:55:38,918 --> 00:55:41,358
Harry, just... please don't die today!

950
00:55:41,838 --> 00:55:44,358
I don't wanna see my best friend
get eaten by a dragon!

951
00:55:44,358 --> 00:55:45,818
Hey, relax, okay?

952
00:55:45,988 --> 00:55:47,388
Save the tears for my funeral.

953
00:55:49,298 --> 00:55:51,828
So, tell me more about this Pigfarts!

954
00:55:51,958 --> 00:55:53,908
I FIND it to be very interesting.

955
00:55:54,838 --> 00:55:58,388
Well, while you're there you have to
wear your space suit at all times,

956
00:55:58,598 --> 00:56:00,188
'cause there's no atmosphere on mars.

957
00:56:00,338 --> 00:56:03,658
So if a single docking bay door opens,
you'll probably die.

958
00:56:04,218 --> 00:56:05,718
Oh my. How dreadful!

959
00:56:05,878 --> 00:56:07,498
Well, the good news is:

960
00:56:07,668 --> 00:56:11,638
If you're a good enough student,
Rumbleroar let's you ride around
on his back.

961
00:56:13,378 --> 00:56:15,308
And...And he is the headmaster lion?

962
00:56:15,438 --> 00:56:16,578
Who can talk!

963
00:56:16,778 --> 00:56:17,728
Cool!

964
00:56:18,398 --> 00:56:20,628
Well, hello Harry.
How are you feeling today?

965
00:56:20,758 --> 00:56:23,618
Hi Cedric. Trying... to stay positive.

966
00:56:24,438 --> 00:56:26,818
Oh, good. I', happy to FIND
you this well.

967
00:56:27,978 --> 00:56:29,048
Mrs. Granger?

968
00:56:29,288 --> 00:56:30,178
Hello...

969
00:56:30,328 --> 00:56:31,528
Sugar pie?

970
00:56:31,738 --> 00:56:32,888
My darling?

971
00:56:34,868 --> 00:56:36,328
Was that a kiss for good luck?

972
00:56:36,428 --> 00:56:39,008
No, that was just for being so
cotton-candy cute.

973
00:56:39,118 --> 00:56:40,578
This one's for good luck!

974
00:56:41,998 --> 00:56:43,318
I hate that guy!

975
00:56:43,448 --> 00:56:45,238
It's okay, Harry. You gonna be great!

976
00:56:45,348 --> 00:56:49,778
Oh! God! Granger,
I thought you were a Vogon!
I'm terrified of Vogons!

977
00:56:51,258 --> 00:56:55,798
And what the hell are you doing
in the champions tend? Get out of here!
Ten more points!

978
00:56:56,398 --> 00:56:57,428
Thanks Hermione!

979
00:56:57,928 --> 00:57:02,918
Are you kids ready to fight a DRAGON???

980
00:57:03,138 --> 00:57:05,448
Of course not! You're just children!
What the hell am I thinking?

981
00:57:06,668 --> 00:57:12,218
Outside of this tend are thousands upon
thousands of screaming fans! They'll either
gonna be cheering for YOU - or the dragon!

982
00:57:12,398 --> 00:57:14,018
But either way they're gonna
make some kind of noise.

983
00:57:14,188 --> 00:57:17,578
So, in order for the
selection process to be fair,

984
00:57:17,698 --> 00:57:23,338
I am going to RANDOMLY select a cardboard
cut out size version of the dragon
you'll be facing.

985
00:57:24,708 --> 00:57:25,868
For you, Cedric:

986
00:57:26,388 --> 00:57:28,258
Puff the magic dragon.

987
00:57:30,678 --> 00:57:33,058
Figment - the imaginary dragon.

988
00:57:34,528 --> 00:57:37,198
The reluctant dragon.

989
00:57:39,048 --> 00:57:40,298
And for you, Potter:

990
00:57:40,888 --> 00:57:44,198
The Hungarian Horntail!
The most terrifying thing ever seen
in your whole life!

991
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:47,280
Oh my god.
Oh my god.

992
00:57:48,548 --> 00:57:51,148
Don't worry, the real thing far 
more more terrifying! 

993
00:57:51,148 --> 00:57:55,148
Ten stories tall. Each scale
as sharp as a LASER beam.

994
00:57:56,148 --> 00:58:00,148
In comparison to that one, this guy
is just a little old pussycat.

995
00:58:00,588 --> 00:58:05,148
Floppy crusty old 
smelly worn out pussycat.

996
00:58:07,648 --> 00:58:09,428
Anyway, if there are no more complains, I...

997
00:58:09,708 --> 00:58:11,248
Wai... wai... hold on a second!
Wait a second!

998
00:58:11,248 --> 00:58:14,228
This is terrifying!
Those are the cutest things
I've ever seen...

999
00:58:15,448 --> 00:58:17,538
This thing is horrifying!

1000
00:58:17,538 --> 00:58:19,328
Just use your imagination.

1001
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:20,828
Disaparate!

1002
00:58:23,648 --> 00:58:27,988
My god, this competition is gonna suck!
All these dragons are wimps!
Accio double stuffed. [cream]

1003
00:58:31,688 --> 00:58:35,108
OH, MY GOD! A MONSTER!
Is that yours?!

1004
00:58:35,258 --> 00:58:35,808
Yeah!

1005
00:58:35,928 --> 00:58:37,438
Oh my god! It's awesome.
Let me hold it.

1006
00:58:38,648 --> 00:58:42,098
Oh my god, this thing is terrifying!
I hope the real thing is smaller!

1007
00:58:42,378 --> 00:58:42,998
Grrrrr!

1008
00:58:44,048 --> 00:58:45,698
Ferocious what are you gonna do?

1009
00:58:45,868 --> 00:58:47,188
I don't know I'm not cut out
for this kinda...

1010
00:58:47,478 --> 00:58:49,778
Ron! Ron, you can't be in here!
This is the champions tent...!

1011
00:58:49,778 --> 00:58:51,398
Mrs. Granger!

1012
00:58:51,868 --> 00:58:54,078
What the devil are you doing
in the champions tent?

1013
00:58:54,208 --> 00:58:55,508
Ten points from Gryffindore!

1014
00:58:55,698 --> 00:58:57,428
Oh, thanks Hermione!

1015
00:58:57,598 --> 00:58:59,218
Good luck, buddy! Bye Snape!

1016
00:58:59,408 --> 00:59:00,538
Bye!

1017
00:59:04,648 --> 00:59:06,188
Cedric Diggory:

1018
00:59:06,348 --> 00:59:09,558
Now is your chance to face - your dragon.

1019
00:59:09,848 --> 00:59:11,378
All right, fellows. Wish me luck!

1020
00:59:11,788 --> 00:59:12,988
I believe in you!

1021
00:59:13,538 --> 00:59:16,098
That's all I needed to hear!

1022
00:59:19,038 --> 00:59:20,338
Hey Malfoy, tell you what:

1023
00:59:20,638 --> 00:59:26,598
I'll let you switch dragons with me. I'll give
YOU the chance to switch dragons with me!
I'll give you that opportunity.

1024
00:59:26,658 --> 00:59:27,978
Hmm, let me think about... no!

1025
00:59:29,268 --> 00:59:31,218
Come on! I'll - I'll give you my "Gushers".

1026
00:59:32,248 --> 00:59:35,888
Oh, no. No. I have a "fruit-by-the-foot".

1027
00:59:38,098 --> 00:59:42,758
Cho Chang, your dragon awaits!

1028
00:59:42,888 --> 00:59:46,418
Well, I can't IMAGINE
if this would be very hard?

1029
00:59:46,578 --> 00:59:49,418
Then I IMAGINED it won't be!

1030
00:59:54,438 --> 01:00:00,638
Come on! Tell you what: I'll throw in my
teddy bears with "Gushers" So you can
make a littler Gusher-teddy bear sandwich.

1031
01:00:00,748 --> 01:00:06,268
All right, you throw in that pack of Bugles
and you got yourself the deal.

1032
01:00:08,498 --> 01:00:10,008
Absolutely not!

1033
01:00:11,798 --> 01:00:13,458
Draco Malfoy...

1034
01:00:17,078 --> 01:00:23,768
Professor Snape, is there a way that I can
kinda forfeit or switch dragons? Or maybe...
What?!? What are you doing?

1035
01:00:23,848 --> 01:00:25,438
I'm protecting you, Potter!

1036
01:00:25,718 --> 01:00:29,008
Welsh Greenbacks can't STAND the taste
of Hans tomato ketchup.

1037
01:00:30,718 --> 01:00:33,698
But I'm not fighting a Welsh Greenback.
I'm fighting a Hungarian Horntail.

1038
01:00:34,758 --> 01:00:36,558
Oh, silly me!

1039
01:00:36,818 --> 01:00:40,448
Hans tomato ketchup is what
Hungarian Horntails like best of all.

1040
01:00:41,358 --> 01:00:42,908
Good luck, Potter!

1041
01:00:44,628 --> 01:00:50,318
And now Harry Potter will battle the terrifying
Hungarian Horntail, the most terrifying thing
you've ever seen in your whole life.

1042
01:00:50,398 --> 01:00:55,958
It should be noted, that this particular dragon
has not been fed in two weeks!

1043
01:00:56,078 --> 01:01:00,078
Come on, Harry!
You can do it, Harry!
Just think positive, you can do it!

1044
01:01:07,178 --> 01:01:08,518
Oh my god!

1045
01:01:09,928 --> 01:01:11,488
Accio Guitar!

1046
01:01:20,078 --> 01:01:21,718
Hey dragon

1047
01:01:23,218 --> 01:01:25,168
you don't gotta do this

1048
01:01:27,478 --> 01:01:29,578
Let's re-evaluate our options

1049
01:01:29,958 --> 01:01:31,698
throw away our old presumptions

1050
01:01:31,838 --> 01:01:34,988
'cause really 
you don't gotta go through this 

1051
01:01:35,828 --> 01:01:37,298
Im really not that special

1052
01:01:37,728 --> 01:01:40,538
the Boy Who Lived is only flesh and bone

1053
01:01:43,078 --> 01:01:44,768
the truth is in the end

1054
01:01:44,928 --> 01:01:47,048
I'm pretty useless without friends

1055
01:01:48,178 --> 01:01:50,198
In fact I'm alone

1056
01:01:54,158 --> 01:01:55,528
I spend my time at school

1057
01:01:55,838 --> 01:01:58,698
trying to be this cool guy

1058
01:01:59,498 --> 01:02:01,728
I never even asked for

1059
01:02:01,828 --> 01:02:03,338
I don't know any spells

1060
01:02:03,458 --> 01:02:05,318
Still manage to do well

1061
01:02:05,408 --> 01:02:08,478
But theres only so long that can last for

1062
01:02:08,898 --> 01:02:10,888
I'm living off the glory

1063
01:02:11,318 --> 01:02:13,948
of some stupid children's story

1064
01:02:14,208 --> 01:02:16,108
that I had nothing to do with

1065
01:02:16,908 --> 01:02:18,678
I just sat there and got lucky

1066
01:02:18,968 --> 01:02:20,938
so level with me buddy

1067
01:02:21,508 --> 01:02:24,358
I can't defeat thee

1068
01:02:26,008 --> 01:02:28,708
so please don't eat me

1069
01:02:29,168 --> 01:02:31,178
And all I can do

1070
01:02:32,378 --> 01:02:34,918
is sing this song for you

1071
01:02:36,528 --> 01:02:38,268
Lalalalala

1072
01:02:38,738 --> 01:02:40,238
Rarararara

1073
01:02:40,388 --> 01:02:42,218
Lalalalala

1074
01:02:42,338 --> 01:02:43,998
Rarararara

1075
01:02:44,478 --> 01:02:46,078
Lalalalala

1076
01:02:46,288 --> 01:02:47,958
Rarararara

1077
01:02:48,168 --> 01:02:49,998
Lalalalala

1078
01:02:51,958 --> 01:02:53,598
You never asked to be a dragon

1079
01:02:53,698 --> 01:02:55,378
I never asked to be a champion

1080
01:02:55,528 --> 01:02:59,788
We both just jumped on the band wagon
but all we need is guitar jamming

1081
01:03:01,498 --> 01:03:08,988
Lalalala...
Rarararara...

1082
01:03:11,148 --> 01:03:12,558
Goodnight Dragon!

1083
01:03:23,808 --> 01:03:26,248
One! Two! Three! I beat the dragon!

1084
01:03:39,511 --> 01:03:42,221
Attention all Hogwarts students!

1085
01:03:42,341 --> 01:03:44,721
Tonight is our Annual Yuleball.

1086
01:03:44,831 --> 01:03:47,801
so please make ready to pick up your
Yule-ball-wreath

1087
01:03:47,911 --> 01:03:52,821
and give it to that special someone.

1088
01:03:54,931 --> 01:03:56,381
Ah! Ginger!

1089
01:04:08,171 --> 01:04:10,431
Oh, hey Harry Potter...

1090
01:04:10,551 --> 01:04:11,211
Hi Ginny.

1091
01:04:11,321 --> 01:04:12,931
Fancy seeing you here, ah?

1092
01:04:13,161 --> 01:04:15,151
Ah, well, it's the cafeteria, so, yeah...

1093
01:04:17,411 --> 01:04:20,501
Ah...so, ah... the Yuleball is coming up...

1094
01:04:20,611 --> 01:04:22,801
Yeah, I know it is... very very soon, yeah...

1095
01:04:22,981 --> 01:04:25,271
Ahm... oh, were you thinking of
going with anybody?

1096
01:04:25,461 --> 01:04:29,181
I was. I was actually just waiting for the
right time to ask somebody. I think...

1097
01:04:29,351 --> 01:04:31,301
I think the time's about now, so if...

1098
01:04:31,881 --> 01:04:34,601
... if you have something to say, just...
get it out, 'cuz...

1099
01:04:37,391 --> 01:04:39,541
Aaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhh

1100
01:04:39,831 --> 01:04:40,941
Oh, is this for me?

1101
01:04:41,871 --> 01:04:45,571
Oh Ginny, how did you know that I needed a
wreath, so I can ask Cho Chang?
You're the best!

1102
01:04:47,281 --> 01:04:50,361
Oh, Harry Potter...!!!

1103
01:04:50,511 --> 01:04:52,821
Just y... forget it!!!

1104
01:04:54,341 --> 01:04:55,761
Alright, I will!

1105
01:04:58,421 --> 01:04:59,391
Cool!

1106
01:05:00,801 --> 01:05:03,261
Hey! Hey, Cho Chang, listen... ahm:

1107
01:05:03,381 --> 01:05:06,441
I know the Yuleball's coming up, 
and I was wondering if, ah...

1108
01:05:06,621 --> 01:05:10,771
...maybe you wanted to go with me,
BUT just in case you're kind of...
on the fence about it,

1109
01:05:10,891 --> 01:05:12,491
you should know that I play guitar

1110
01:05:12,601 --> 01:05:14,941
and that I conquered that
dragons heart with it,

1111
01:05:14,961 --> 01:05:16,361
so I think, I conquer yours.

1112
01:05:16,951 --> 01:05:20,391
You're tall and fun and pretty,
you're really, really skinny.

1113
01:05:20,671 --> 01:05:22,711
Cho Chang!

1114
01:05:22,991 --> 01:05:26,361
I'm gonna take you to the city
Get all up in your titties!

1115
01:05:27,071 --> 01:05:28,591
Cho Chang!

1116
01:05:29,491 --> 01:05:32,861
You're the Mickey to my Minnie
I'm the Tigger to your Winnie,

1117
01:05:33,571 --> 01:05:35,091
Cho Chang!

1118
01:05:35,831 --> 01:05:38,011
You're cuter than a guinnie pig,

1119
01:05:38,711 --> 01:05:40,531
Wanna take you up to Winepeg

1120
01:05:40,651 --> 01:05:42,411
That's in Canada!

1121
01:05:43,111 --> 01:05:45,121
Oh, Cho Chang!

1122
01:05:45,261 --> 01:05:47,851
Ch... Ch.. Ch...
ChinaChinaChina - Cho Chang!

1123
01:05:48,011 --> 01:05:48,651
Whatever...

1124
01:05:50,951 --> 01:05:52,941
My oh, Harry Potter!

1125
01:05:53,571 --> 01:05:54,781
Bless your heart!

1126
01:05:55,581 --> 01:05:57,941
But...ah...I have to say no.

1127
01:05:58,361 --> 01:06:03,831
That young strapping boy Cedric Diggory
already asked me and I just go with him.

1128
01:06:04,881 --> 01:06:05,971
Sorry...

1129
01:06:06,671 --> 01:06:09,811
Come on, girls! Let's go show the
Moaning Myrtle our ball gaunts

1130
01:06:09,941 --> 01:06:11,541
and make fun of her 'cause she can't go!

1131
01:06:21,401 --> 01:06:22,711
Hey there, good buddy!
How're you doing?

1132
01:06:23,291 --> 01:06:24,371
Okay...

1133
01:06:24,501 --> 01:06:25,501
Is that a yule-ball-wreath?

1134
01:06:25,841 --> 01:06:26,441
Yeah...

1135
01:06:26,571 --> 01:06:28,051
Who you gonna ask?

1136
01:06:30,041 --> 01:06:33,771
Well, I've asked Cho Chang, but she
turned me down for Cedric Stupery!

1137
01:06:33,901 --> 01:06:37,531
Oh my god, they're going together?
That's so great! I love him so!
They are so a cute couple...

1138
01:06:37,531 --> 01:06:38,671
No! No!

1139
01:06:38,791 --> 01:06:40,501
...I hate him! I hate him so much!

1140
01:06:40,631 --> 01:06:42,191
Oh my god, he pisses me off...! Wow!

1141
01:06:43,501 --> 01:06:44,711
Oh man, that sucks, dude.

1142
01:06:44,841 --> 01:06:47,181
I don't know why she turned you down,
you're like the coolest guy in school!

1143
01:06:47,311 --> 01:06:50,261
I know, I don't get it! I play guitar,
I'm Harry Potter! I'm awesome!

1144
01:06:50,431 --> 01:06:51,371
You want some cheese-twigs?

1145
01:06:51,481 --> 01:06:52,121
Yeah.

1146
01:06:53,071 --> 01:06:55,501
I don't get it man.I mean I guess
I will just go as stag, ah?

1147
01:06:55,501 --> 01:06:56,991
I'll probably go stag, too.

1148
01:06:56,991 --> 01:06:59,871
The only two girls that I know, 
that don't have dates already,
are Ginny...

1149
01:07:00,701 --> 01:07:01,441
...and Hermione.

1150
01:07:01,551 --> 01:07:02,221
Oh my god!

1151
01:07:03,861 --> 01:07:05,381
I'm not going with my stupid sister!

1152
01:07:05,501 --> 01:07:07,701
And I think of Hermione as sister.
So that's out!

1153
01:07:07,841 --> 01:07:10,051
We are in such a puzzle.

1154
01:07:11,491 --> 01:07:13,521
Hi, look at these strapping young men.
s
1153
01:07:07,121 --> 01:07:07,851
Hi, Neville.

1155
01:07:15,481 --> 01:07:16,161
Hey, Neville:

1156
01:07:16,461 --> 01:07:17,901
Want this Yule-ball-wreath?

1157
01:07:18,091 --> 01:07:20,441
Well, yeah, if you're willing to part
with it, then I will take this for you.

1158
01:07:20,701 --> 01:07:22,011
Hey, Ron: Let's go hang out with Hagrid.

1159
01:07:22,111 --> 01:07:23,671
He can teach us how to dance
and we're getting our dress-ropes.

1160
01:07:24,161 --> 01:07:26,581
That can only lead to disaster and hilarity.

1161
01:07:26,721 --> 01:07:27,331
Let's go!

1162
01:07:28,021 --> 01:07:34,331
I mean, i just don't know about Hermione,
i don't think anyone is asking her you know because,
she is just so butt-ugly.

1163
01:07:39,241 --> 01:07:40,211
Give that plant, nerd!

1164
01:07:40,211 --> 01:07:40,861
Ahhh!

1165
01:07:42,631 --> 01:07:44,931
Oh, Goyle rules!

1166
01:07:50,061 --> 01:07:51,421
So anyway,

1167
01:07:51,561 --> 01:07:53,521
It was RELUCTANT enough at first...
[The reluctant dragon]

1168
01:07:54,071 --> 01:07:57,281
....But I lured it out of it's cage
with an upside down face.

1169
01:07:57,751 --> 01:08:00,011
And I soed it with my "Fruit-by-the-foot" ...

1170
01:08:00,181 --> 01:08:03,141
and beheaded it with a quick slicing-charm.
Bloody fool.

1171
01:08:03,651 --> 01:08:04,681
What?!? Goyle?

1172
01:08:05,161 --> 01:08:08,281
What are you doing with that wreath?
Would you going to ask someone
to the Yule-ball?

1173
01:08:08,471 --> 01:08:09,731
N...n..no!

1174
01:08:10,291 --> 01:08:11,481
Dancing's for nerds!

1175
01:08:11,591 --> 01:08:12,811
And pretty girls!

1176
01:08:12,921 --> 01:08:13,481
Right.

1177
01:08:14,991 --> 01:08:18,091
Do you know who the last girl I'd
have asked to the Yule-ball would be?

1178
01:08:19,151 --> 01:08:21,151
That Hermione Granger.

1179
01:08:23,271 --> 01:08:26,181
Not even if we were the last
two people on earth...

1180
01:08:26,301 --> 01:08:28,991
and she looked absolutely stunning
in her ball gown...

1181
01:08:29,101 --> 01:08:31,431
and ever time I looked at her,
I got butterflies in my tummy...

1182
01:08:34,581 --> 01:08:35,831
Not even then.

1183
01:08:37,411 --> 01:08:38,241
Ugh!

1184
01:08:38,551 --> 01:08:40,621
They don't even have dances at Pigfarts.

1185
01:08:41,521 --> 01:08:44,441
All the noise would disturb Rumbleroars
slumbering cubs.

1186
01:08:47,661 --> 01:08:49,801
Dancing is for Pansies.

1187
01:08:51,541 --> 01:08:52,971
Ey you there, what's your name?

1188
01:08:53,041 --> 01:08:53,821
Pansy.

1189
01:08:54,131 --> 01:08:54,841
Perfect!

1190
01:08:55,901 --> 01:08:57,541
You're going to the Yule-ball with me.

1191
01:08:57,891 --> 01:08:59,051
You see that dragon?

1192
01:08:59,401 --> 01:09:03,311
Well, it was reluctant enough at first,
but I lured it out of it's cage
with an upside down face.

1193
01:09:03,621 --> 01:09:05,411
Yule-ball-decorating-crew!

1194
01:09:05,551 --> 01:09:09,011
Does the Yule-ball-decoration-crew
coming through!

1195
01:09:09,011 --> 01:09:10,641
Last minute decorations.

1196
01:09:15,431 --> 01:09:16,771
Hu-ha!

1197
01:09:18,121 --> 01:09:21,631
My Lord! The Yule-ball has finally arrived
and I've brought the key.

1198
01:09:21,741 --> 01:09:26,191
Yes, I KNOW Quirrel.
I HEAR everything you HEAR!

1199
01:09:27,211 --> 01:09:28,621
I'm sorry.

1200
01:09:30,051 --> 01:09:33,001
No, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have snapped.

1201
01:09:34,371 --> 01:09:35,951
I'm just nervous, that's all.

1202
01:09:36,201 --> 01:09:36,801
Nervous?

1203
01:09:36,981 --> 01:09:37,451
No.

1204
01:09:37,561 --> 01:09:37,991
Why?

1205
01:09:38,101 --> 01:09:39,161
I don't wanna talk about it.

1206
01:09:40,701 --> 01:09:42,341
Hey! It's just me.

1207
01:09:42,751 --> 01:09:45,061
You can tell me ANYTHING.
You know that.

1208
01:09:46,841 --> 01:09:48,661
Yeah, yeah. You're right, you're right.

1209
01:09:49,981 --> 01:09:53,261
I'm just nervous because we've been
planning this night for so long,

1210
01:09:53,531 --> 01:09:56,021
and... I want everything to go perfectly,
you know?

1211
01:09:56,161 --> 01:09:58,801
Don't worry.
We've mapped out everything.

1212
01:09:58,971 --> 01:10:02,091
We've anticipated every little problem
and compensated for it.

1213
01:10:02,211 --> 01:10:05,251
We've even prepared what you're
going to say to Potter when you see him.

1214
01:10:05,701 --> 01:10:07,081
So just cool down.

1215
01:10:07,201 --> 01:10:08,271
Relax.

1216
01:10:08,481 --> 01:10:11,761
By the end of the night you'll have
your revenge and your body back.

1217
01:10:11,871 --> 01:10:14,371
You're right, you're right, I'm being...silly.

1218
01:10:16,121 --> 01:10:17,131
But..uhm...

1219
01:10:17,471 --> 01:10:18,721
I..you know, I...

1220
01:10:20,421 --> 01:10:22,041
Quirrell, over the last year I....

1221
01:10:22,171 --> 01:10:24,131
I've really grown attached to you.

1222
01:10:25,361 --> 01:10:26,821
No pun intended.

1223
01:10:27,421 --> 01:10:29,071
Yeah, I know what you mean.

1224
01:10:29,541 --> 01:10:31,211
But hey! We'll still hang out.

1225
01:10:31,461 --> 01:10:34,821
Just because we won't be attached,
doesn't mean we'll be two completely
different people.

1226
01:10:35,061 --> 01:10:36,001
No pun intended.

1227
01:10:36,121 --> 01:10:37,901
No, no! Of course not! Of course not...

1228
01:10:40,231 --> 01:10:43,051
Hey, Quirrell. We should make plans.

1229
01:10:43,161 --> 01:10:43,971
Evil plans?

1230
01:10:44,161 --> 01:10:45,681
Oh,...ah...

1231
01:10:45,911 --> 01:10:48,211
No. Casual plans.

1232
01:10:48,621 --> 01:10:50,081
Like...ahm..

1233
01:10:50,151 --> 01:10:52,921
...you go rollerblading on Saturday,
and then, ahm...

1234
01:10:53,211 --> 01:10:54,251
see a movie at night.

1235
01:10:54,741 --> 01:10:58,501
Yeah. It'll be great because we'll both
be able to watch it for a change.

1236
01:10:58,721 --> 01:11:00,061
Yeah, yeah...

1237
01:11:00,371 --> 01:11:02,811
I bet it'll be nice to sleep in our own beds.

1238
01:11:03,651 --> 01:11:05,691
Not have someone behind you
all the time...

1239
01:11:07,061 --> 01:11:10,771
And have the privacy
of my old life back again...

1240
01:11:11,641 --> 01:11:12,831
The solitude...

1241
01:11:18,411 --> 01:11:19,201
Now,

1242
01:11:20,731 --> 01:11:23,511
whatever happens tonight, man, it's...

1243
01:11:23,631 --> 01:11:25,201
It's been a blast!

1244
01:11:25,751 --> 01:11:28,061
Yeah. One crazy year!

1245
01:11:28,201 --> 01:11:29,021
Yeah!

1246
01:11:30,851 --> 01:11:31,861
Hey!

1247
01:11:32,001 --> 01:11:34,171
Promise we'll go rollerblading
and see that movie!

1248
01:11:34,311 --> 01:11:36,611
Oh, man. I promise!

1249
01:11:43,831 --> 01:11:44,761
Okay.

1250
01:11:45,221 --> 01:11:48,621
Qurrell: Let's go plant that key and split.

1251
01:11:48,851 --> 01:11:49,911
Pun intended!

1252
01:11:54,111 --> 01:11:55,881
Oh, hi Professor Quirrell.

1253
01:11:57,541 --> 01:12:00,021
What on earth are you doing
in the great Daaancehaaall?

1254
01:12:00,141 --> 01:12:01,971
Just moments before the daaaance?

1255
01:12:03,861 --> 01:12:07,461
Just... decorating for the Yule-ball.
Last minute decorations.

1256
01:12:07,631 --> 01:12:08,951
Just one final Touch.

1257
01:12:09,081 --> 01:12:10,181
A ladle?

1258
01:12:10,721 --> 01:12:15,341
A very special ladle for a very special night
for a very special punch.

1259
01:12:15,571 --> 01:12:18,051
And what's so special about it?

1260
01:12:18,291 --> 01:12:20,931
Let's just say there's... squirt in it.

1261
01:12:21,061 --> 01:12:21,751
Squirt?!?

1262
01:12:22,911 --> 01:12:25,771
Is that not the favorite drink
of one Harry Potter?

1263
01:12:27,891 --> 01:12:30,921
Is it? I had no idea!

1264
01:12:31,131 --> 01:12:32,701
Well, we better be going...

1265
01:12:32,831 --> 01:12:33,401
We?!?

1266
01:12:33,731 --> 01:12:38,001
I! I better be going.
Loud music hurts my ears!

1267
01:12:38,461 --> 01:12:40,201
Okay, well, I'll see you later then.

1268
01:12:40,351 --> 01:12:41,441
Or maybe you won't!

1269
01:12:41,571 --> 01:12:42,531
Or maybe I will!

1270
01:12:45,891 --> 01:12:46,851
Excuse me.

1271
01:12:46,881 --> 01:12:48,451
No, excuse me. It was my fault.

1272
01:12:48,711 --> 01:12:49,931
Hey Severus!

1273
01:12:50,041 --> 01:12:51,661
Oh, ah Headmaster!

1274
01:12:51,781 --> 01:12:53,071
What are you doing here?
You're getting some punch, are you?

1275
01:12:53,181 --> 01:12:55,131
Oh, no, no! There's Squirt in there!

1276
01:12:55,231 --> 01:12:59,191
Only Harry Potter likes that hog shit.
I'll stick to my Red Bull.
Thank you very much.

1277
01:13:00,171 --> 01:13:02,001
Well, good night, headmaster.

1278
01:13:02,171 --> 01:13:05,081
Serverus, I...
I saved this last dance for you.
[Oldie: Save the last dance for me]

1279
01:13:05,861 --> 01:13:08,031
Well, I would, headmaster, but you see:...

1280
01:13:08,361 --> 01:13:11,331
Well, an old friend is coming back
into town tonight...

1281
01:13:17,361 --> 01:13:18,331
The fuck?

1282
01:13:37,856 --> 01:13:38,316
Hey Ron.

1283
01:13:38,316 --> 01:13:39,056
Hey,what's up there? How's it going?
Hey Ron.

1284
01:13:39,196 --> 01:13:40,386
Have you seen Hermione anywhere?

1285
01:13:40,486 --> 01:13:41,026
No I haven't.

1286
01:13:41,146 --> 01:13:41,566
Shit.

1287
01:13:41,886 --> 01:13:42,606
What?

1288
01:13:42,786 --> 01:13:44,216
Nothing, nothing.

1289
01:13:44,376 --> 01:13:45,716
It's just, you know...

1290
01:13:46,356 --> 01:13:48,486
I heard Parvati Patil telling Padma Patil, that

1291
01:13:48,826 --> 01:13:51,136
she'd seen Hermione in the girls
Locker room before, just..

1292
01:13:51,286 --> 01:13:53,246
crying her eyes out on the bathroom stall.

1293
01:13:53,506 --> 01:13:54,036
Why?

1294
01:13:54,176 --> 01:13:56,356
I don't know, is that not the saddest
thing you ever heard?

1295
01:13:56,586 --> 01:14:02,156
I mean, I don't know, it's just... It was 
inevatible that one day Hermione would realize
that no guy would ever like her.

1296
01:14:02,206 --> 01:14:05,456
You know... Because of her obnoxious personality,

1297
01:14:05,746 --> 01:14:07,016
and her ugly face,

1298
01:14:07,136 --> 01:14:08,016
and the shape of her body...

1299
01:14:08,726 --> 01:14:13,076
But you know, it's just... I don't know,
I figured that she'd get in at least 
one night of happiness,

1300
01:14:13,296 --> 01:14:15,436
before she realized she's gonna be going
old alone, you know?

1301
01:14:15,646 --> 01:14:17,576
Hey, are you two over here
talking about Granger?

1302
01:14:17,706 --> 01:14:20,616
Malfoy get out of here, 
it's none of your business. Why don't you go
dancing with pansy over there.

1303
01:14:21,896 --> 01:14:23,706
Hey! Go get me some punch!

1304
01:14:23,856 --> 01:14:24,396
Okay.

1305
01:14:25,636 --> 01:14:28,636
Wait, ehm, I should tell you
there's squirt in it.

1306
01:14:28,636 --> 01:14:28,766
Oh nice.

1307
01:14:28,766 --> 01:14:30,066
Squirt?!?

1308
01:14:30,586 --> 01:14:33,056
Never mind, I'll STAY dehydrated!

1309
01:14:34,826 --> 01:14:36,766
Go powder your nose or something.

1310
01:14:37,036 --> 01:14:39,746
I just fixed my make up a little while ago.

1311
01:14:40,846 --> 01:14:43,016
Trust me: You need more powder!

1312
01:14:44,876 --> 01:14:46,226
She's a pain in the ass, right?

1313
01:14:48,306 --> 01:14:49,466
So anyway:

1314
01:14:49,956 --> 01:14:51,756
Those stranger's not 'round here?

1315
01:14:52,026 --> 01:14:58,016
Probably the better doing! No one would be able
to keep their plummers and peach's down with
that ugly mug of her's dancing about!

1316
01:14:58,366 --> 01:15:01,056
Why don't you just give her a break for once,
okay Malfoy?

1317
01:15:02,376 --> 01:15:04,356
Why defending her, Weasley?

1318
01:15:04,676 --> 01:15:05,766
Have a crush?

1319
01:15:05,776 --> 01:15:06,516
No...

1320
01:15:07,006 --> 01:15:10,386
No, why all the insults, Malfoy?
Covering up a crush?

1321
01:15:10,686 --> 01:15:14,496
Oh! Right, right! Like I'd ever have a crush
on that stupid...

1322
01:15:14,686 --> 01:15:17,476
Oh my GOSH!

1323
01:15:19,516 --> 01:15:22,356
She look's so beautiful, bless her heart!

1324
01:15:28,966 --> 01:15:32,276
Here I am face to face with a situation

1325
01:15:32,436 --> 01:15:35,656
I never thought I'd ever see.

1326
01:15:35,656 --> 01:15:38,576
strange how a dress can take a mess,

1327
01:15:38,736 --> 01:15:43,636
and make her nothing less than...
beautiful to me.

1328
01:15:44,696 --> 01:15:48,606
It seems like my eyes
have been transfigured

1329
01:15:48,746 --> 01:15:51,696
something deep inside has changed

1330
01:15:52,676 --> 01:15:57,196
they've been open wide,
but hold that trigger

1331
01:15:57,976 --> 01:16:06,486
this could mean... Danger.

1332
01:16:07,016 --> 01:16:12,116
I'm falling in love,
falling in love,
falling in love,

1333
01:16:12,576 --> 01:16:18,686
I could be falling in love,
falling in love,
falling in love

1334
01:16:19,426 --> 01:16:22,126
with Hermione Granger!

1335
01:16:28,996 --> 01:16:31,036
WHAT? What the hell is this?

1336
01:16:31,196 --> 01:16:33,936
YOU expect me to sing about her?

1337
01:16:34,196 --> 01:16:36,056
I don't care about her.

1338
01:16:36,576 --> 01:16:39,726
it's just a little make up

1339
01:16:40,096 --> 01:16:41,726
Draco, wake up!

1340
01:16:42,076 --> 01:16:44,116
I'm mistaken!

1341
01:16:44,306 --> 01:16:48,016
she -  is the hottest girl I've ever seen.

1342
01:16:48,346 --> 01:16:51,866
now -  because she's like a girl
I've never seen.

1343
01:16:51,926 --> 01:16:57,226
don't know why -  I'd ever be so mean.

1344
01:16:58,056 --> 01:17:05,786
this could mean DANGER!

1345
01:17:06,956 --> 01:17:12,196
I'm falling in love,
falling in love,
falling in love,

1346
01:17:12,866 --> 01:17:19,106
I could be falling in love,
falling in love,
falling in love

1347
01:17:19,546 --> 01:17:23,476
With Hermione Granger!

1348
01:17:24,276 --> 01:17:26,456
I WANNA LET HER KNOW
I WANNA LET HER KNOW

1349
01:17:26,596 --> 01:17:28,556
I FEEL SO QUEEZY

1350
01:17:28,846 --> 01:17:30,366
BUT I CAN'T LET IT SHOW
BUT I CAN'T LET IT SHOW

1351
01:17:30,706 --> 01:17:32,236
SHE'D LAUGH, POOR WEASLY.

1352
01:17:32,596 --> 01:17:35,396
Come on, Ron.
Come on,...Draco.

1353
01:17:35,556 --> 01:17:43,846
You gotta let it go! You gotta let it go!
You gotta let it go! You gotta let it go!

1354
01:17:44,266 --> 01:17:48,046
WHAT? What the hell is this?
Here I am face to face with a situation

1355
01:17:48,416 --> 01:17:51,446
I want to sing about her
sing about her.
I never thought I'd ever see.

1356
01:17:51,636 --> 01:17:54,036
I want to make up
Strange how a dress
can take a mess,

1357
01:17:54,306 --> 01:17:59,456
Granger, wake up
I've been mistaken.
and make her nothing less than
beautiful to me.

1358
01:18:00,016 --> 01:18:03,626
She - is the hottest girl I've ever seen.
It seems like my eyes
have been transfigured

1359
01:18:03,756 --> 01:18:07,256
Now - 'CAUSE she's like a girl
I've never seen.
something deep inside has changed

1360
01:18:07,556 --> 01:18:12,816
Don't know why -  I'd ever be so mean.
they've been open wide,
but hold that trigger

1361
01:18:13,206 --> 01:18:21,216
This could mean DANGER!

1362
01:18:22,096 --> 01:18:27,306
I'm falling in love,
falling in love,
falling in love,

1363
01:18:27,806 --> 01:18:33,896
I could be falling in love,
falling in love,
falling in love

1364
01:18:34,736 --> 01:18:38,066
With Hermione Granger!

1365
01:18:38,616 --> 01:18:41,726
With Hermione Granger!

1366
01:18:41,966 --> 01:18:45,726
With Hermione Granger!

1367
01:18:46,346 --> 01:18:51,506
Danger!

1368
01:18:57,937 --> 01:18:59,957
Oh my god, I can't believe it.

1369
01:19:00,077 --> 01:19:00,607
What?

1370
01:19:00,777 --> 01:19:07,097
I just can't... I can't believe she's dancing
with ever guy but me, That is so...
that's so stupid, that's so...

1371
01:19:07,397 --> 01:19:09,317
Why do you even care about it?

1372
01:19:09,457 --> 01:19:11,017
I don't! I don't care.

1373
01:19:11,287 --> 01:19:13,717
I don't care and that's what
I'm gonna go up and tell her!

1374
01:19:13,867 --> 01:19:16,427
I'm gonna go and say:
I don't care what you do!

1375
01:19:16,887 --> 01:19:20,037
And she's gonna feel so damn stupid.

1376
01:19:20,367 --> 01:19:22,477
She is gonna feel like such an idiot!

1377
01:19:22,637 --> 01:19:26,127
Listen Ron, you're acting like a real jerk,
maybe you should take it easy
on the Butterbeer.

1378
01:19:26,267 --> 01:19:28,837
No! No.

1379
01:19:28,997 --> 01:19:31,297
Hey, Hermine! Hey, you look great!
You look wonderful!
Hey Guys!

1380
01:19:31,577 --> 01:19:37,017
Oh thanks! Yeah, you know, I... I used to
think looks weren't important and now I think
they are more important than anything!

1381
01:19:39,907 --> 01:19:42,277
It's just, I'm having so much fun,
dancing with everyone...

1382
01:19:42,577 --> 01:19:44,537
Wow, Hermione, when did you
become so shallow, when?

1383
01:19:46,637 --> 01:19:48,087
What's wrong with you, Ron?

1384
01:19:48,427 --> 01:19:50,497
Nothing! Nothing's wrong with me!

1385
01:19:50,717 --> 01:19:54,057
Why don't you just go ask schlongbottom
to dance, ha? Go do it!

1386
01:19:54,227 --> 01:19:55,437
You know what? Maybe I will!

1387
01:19:59,617 --> 01:20:01,867
I showed her.
You showed yourself.

1388
01:20:03,317 --> 01:20:06,387
Wait a second! Wait a hot second!
I know what's going on here!

1389
01:20:10,887 --> 01:20:12,147
You've got a crush!

1390
01:20:13,557 --> 01:20:16,127
Alright. Ron, listen... listen to me now:

1391
01:20:16,127 --> 01:20:21,967
Cool advice: just call me crazy.
Girls don't really like it, when you're angry
at them, much less when you shout at them.

1392
01:20:22,297 --> 01:20:26,677
Now maybe you should just go over there
and tell her how much you care about her,
okay?

1393
01:20:26,847 --> 01:20:28,257
Maybe she'd ask you to dance.

1394
01:20:28,417 --> 01:20:30,737
Wha...No, no!
'cuz then she'd know I liked her!

1395
01:20:30,847 --> 01:20:34,327
And you always said, that you don't tell
a girl you liked her. 'Cuz it makes you
look like an idiot.

1396
01:20:34,477 --> 01:20:38,277
I know you look like an idiot any time
you tell a girl you like her it makes you 
look dumb, That is inevitable. But listen

1397
01:20:38,557 --> 01:20:40,057
It's something you have to do!

1398
01:20:40,057 --> 01:20:42,647
You have to look forward to it, alright,
or they'll never like you back.

1399
01:20:42,757 --> 01:20:46,387
Okay? And what have you got to lose?
We look like idiots anyways.
We are wizards, look at our robes!

1400
01:20:47,527 --> 01:20:51,487
If we dressed like this in the muggle world,
we would get our asses kicked!

1401
01:20:51,787 --> 01:20:54,267
You have nothing to lose,
ABSOLUTELY nothing.

1402
01:20:54,667 --> 01:20:56,987
I bet.. you know, she probably wants to dance 
with you just as much as you wanna dance with her.

1403
01:20:57,407 --> 01:20:58,287
You just gotta...

1404
01:21:00,557 --> 01:21:03,757
You... you just gotta... 
give her... a chance!

1405
01:21:04,127 --> 01:21:05,897
There is something there you didn't see before

1406
01:21:06,427 --> 01:21:08,747
You gotta go and maybe find something
special, and...

1407
01:21:09,147 --> 01:21:11,147
...it was there the whole time you
just really didn't have the guts to ...

1408
01:21:11,787 --> 01:21:12,887
...say anything.

1409
01:21:15,157 --> 01:21:17,547
Harry, where are you going?
I'm still mad and sad.

1410
01:21:17,697 --> 01:21:18,857
Hold on!

1411
01:21:19,847 --> 01:21:21,727
HP is going to take his own advice now.

1412
01:21:26,857 --> 01:21:27,527
Hey Ginny.

1413
01:21:27,817 --> 01:21:30,067
Oh... Hey, Harry.

1414
01:21:30,327 --> 01:21:31,227
Can I sit down?

1415
01:21:31,527 --> 01:21:32,647
Ah...yeah...sure...

1416
01:21:33,817 --> 01:21:35,817
Soooooooo...ah... ahm...

1417
01:21:36,667 --> 01:21:37,557
How is Hogwarts?

1418
01:21:39,317 --> 01:21:41,367
You know, it's okay.

1419
01:21:41,687 --> 01:21:44,357
Actually I was really excited
to come here, but...

1420
01:21:44,687 --> 01:21:47,547
now that I'm here I'd...
I just don't think I belong.

1421
01:21:47,707 --> 01:21:49,307
Oh yeah, I totally know, what you mean.

1422
01:21:50,007 --> 01:21:51,937
Ah, no. No.

1423
01:21:53,607 --> 01:21:54,957
For you're Harry Potter.

1424
01:21:55,227 --> 01:22:01,127
Yeah I know. Like for 11 Years I was this dumb
kid they got the crap kicked out of me under
a staircase, now it's like: you're a wizard!

1425
01:22:01,397 --> 01:22:03,887
You have all these powers!
And everything's i'm cool all the sudden.

1426
01:22:04,067 --> 01:22:05,937
It's weird, it's kind of isolating! Ahm, ahm...

1427
01:22:06,347 --> 01:22:08,387
No, I'm sorry, now I'm complaining
about being famous, I'm sorry.

1428
01:22:09,307 --> 01:22:11,597
No, I understand. It's...it's...

1429
01:22:11,987 --> 01:22:16,857
like when you first got here and nobody
wanted to get to know you because they
thought that they knew you already, but...

1430
01:22:17,267 --> 01:22:21,067
eventually you'll find people that'll want
to get to know you for the real you!

1431
01:22:21,607 --> 01:22:25,307
Now Ginny, I feel like I already have found
these people and I won't take it for granted.
So tell you what: Come on!

1432
01:22:25,627 --> 01:22:27,277
Do you wanna dance? 
It's the whole point of the evening.

1433
01:22:31,027 --> 01:22:34,697
I gotta warn you: I learned all my best
dance moves from Hagrid, so...

1434
01:22:35,167 --> 01:22:36,087
I'm not that great.

1435
01:22:36,647 --> 01:22:38,647
Oh, I'm sure you'll be fine.

1436
01:22:39,797 --> 01:22:41,897
Wow! Harry Potter!

1437
01:22:42,117 --> 01:22:46,137
I don't care what anybody says.
You're the best dancer that ever was!

1438
01:22:46,427 --> 01:22:48,657
I've a confession to make, Ginny.
These shoes right here...

1439
01:22:49,267 --> 01:22:51,387
... are magical enchanted dancing shoes.

1440
01:22:51,577 --> 01:22:54,037
Oh wowy, Harry Potter!

1441
01:22:54,387 --> 01:22:55,557
I'm messing with you!

1442
01:22:56,757 --> 01:22:58,317
I'm just awesome at dancing.

1443
01:22:59,977 --> 01:23:01,547
AAAAHH!
Outch!
Hey!

1444
01:23:02,967 --> 01:23:06,737
Alright, I tell you, when you really danced
with Neville it's when you crossed the line,
okay?

1445
01:23:07,017 --> 01:23:08,197
Take this. Beat it! Get out of here!

1446
01:23:08,567 --> 01:23:09,957
Ah!
Come here. COME HERE!

1447
01:23:11,767 --> 01:23:14,177
Ah! Why are you being so mean to me?
I'M NOT BEING MEAN!

1448
01:23:14,587 --> 01:23:16,787
Ow! Yes, you are!

1449
01:23:17,117 --> 01:23:23,017
You know, every day everyone is trying to
put me down, and on the one day I actually
feel like a person you're trying to ruin it!

1450
01:23:23,307 --> 01:23:24,077
Oh shit...!

1451
01:23:24,967 --> 01:23:28,747
What is wrong with you, Ron?!? Come on...

1452
01:23:29,007 --> 01:23:29,737
Weasley!

1453
01:23:40,767 --> 01:23:42,537
The lady said NO!

1454
01:23:43,947 --> 01:23:45,697
Not - YOU - too!

1455
01:23:45,927 --> 01:23:49,807
You know what, I'm so sick of both of you!
I HATE YOU BOTH!!

1456
01:23:54,937 --> 01:23:56,707
What did you say to her?

1457
01:23:56,927 --> 01:23:57,587
Nothing!

1458
01:23:58,667 --> 01:24:00,307
I'm bleeding!
I'm bleeding!

1459
01:24:02,107 --> 01:24:03,137
Look at this!

1460
01:24:04,437 --> 01:24:06,247
Look at this!
Look what she did to me.

1461
01:24:12,917 --> 01:24:16,457
Ginny... Ginny, I'm feeling kind of dizzy.

1462
01:24:17,057 --> 01:24:21,117
Maybe we should stop spinning.
It's from all this spinning, ha?

1463
01:24:22,167 --> 01:24:23,467
We have stopped spinning.
[Anastasia]

1464
01:24:31,357 --> 01:24:32,857
Wait! No! No, no, no, no!

1465
01:24:33,167 --> 01:24:34,627
I can't... I can't do this...you're...

1466
01:24:35,057 --> 01:24:39,727
You're Ginny Weasley, your're my best friend's 
little sister, you're Ron Weasleys sister!
I c... I...I'm sorry, Ginny, I can't do it!

1467
01:24:40,207 --> 01:24:41,067
I'm sorry!

1468
01:24:46,597 --> 01:24:49,377
Hey Cho! Hey, hey, come on, dance with me!
I'm Harry Potter, let's go!

1469
01:24:52,437 --> 01:24:55,497
Excuse me, I believe I was
dancing with the lady!

1470
01:24:55,817 --> 01:24:57,837
Yeah and I'm...cutting in!

1471
01:24:59,007 --> 01:25:02,057
Well, I FIND that to be very rude!

1472
01:25:02,917 --> 01:25:06,457
Alright, Cedric, why don't we FIND out,
what the lady has to say about it?

1473
01:25:07,257 --> 01:25:09,977
Oh boys, this is no need
to fight a little old me!

1474
01:25:10,457 --> 01:25:13,957
But by the ways: Cedric thinks you
cheated on the dragon's task...

1475
01:25:14,257 --> 01:25:17,087
CHEATED? Are you kidding me? 
that thing was trying to eat me!
I was in it's mouth!

1476
01:25:17,517 --> 01:25:21,987
Exactly! But what went on in there?
I'd like to FIND out!

1477
01:25:22,207 --> 01:25:24,607
Alright, that is it Diggory,
we're dueling, let's go!

1478
01:25:25,057 --> 01:25:28,447
Oh, Godderics Hollow. 
All this excitement is making me thirsty!

1479
01:25:29,217 --> 01:25:31,777
Oh, Cho! I'll get you something to drink!
I'll get you some punch!

1480
01:25:31,947 --> 01:25:33,627
No! I'll get the punch!

1481
01:25:33,917 --> 01:25:35,217
No, I'll get the punch!

1482
01:25:35,627 --> 01:25:37,557
Fine! Have the punch!

1483
01:25:40,257 --> 01:25:41,437
You did it!

1484
01:25:42,787 --> 01:25:44,617
Cedric Diggory, I'm gonna kill you!!!

1485
01:26:05,667 --> 01:26:06,827
Where are we?

1486
01:26:08,807 --> 01:26:13,157
I don't know, Cedric. Someone punched
me in the face and my sense of direction
got a little goofed up!

1487
01:26:13,867 --> 01:26:17,417
Well, it seems clear to me now, that that
punch-ladle was a port-key.

1488
01:26:17,867 --> 01:26:22,457
And now - thanks to you! - we've both been
transported to some mystery location!

1489
01:26:24,737 --> 01:26:29,207
Brilliant Cedric! Well, you're a Hufflepuff, so why
don't you FIND a way out of this place, okay?

1490
01:26:29,557 --> 01:26:31,867
Harry I think I FOUND something!

1491
01:26:33,627 --> 01:26:35,957
It appears to be a headstone.

1492
01:26:36,247 --> 01:26:37,957
We must be in some sort of graveyard.

1493
01:26:39,137 --> 01:26:42,377
Tom Riddle, Mary Riddle, Thoms Riddle...

1494
01:26:42,677 --> 01:26:44,357
"Riddle me this", Ay Potter?

1495
01:26:46,717 --> 01:26:48,947
Cedric, I don't know about this place,
I think we gotta get out of here!

1496
01:26:49,787 --> 01:26:52,187
Harry, you're a Gryffindor.
Where's your sense of adventure?

1497
01:26:52,827 --> 01:26:56,627
God! Cedric, you're so annoying, okay?

1498
01:26:56,937 --> 01:27:01,477
You're like this guy, that's just around
all the time, when I don't need
a guy around!

1499
01:27:01,787 --> 01:27:05,977
You're this spare guy all the time!
The spare dude! You're such a spare!

1500
01:27:06,267 --> 01:27:08,257
Kill the spare! Avada Kedavra!

1501
01:27:10,667 --> 01:27:13,907
There are so many regrets... I'm dead!

1502
01:27:17,127 --> 01:27:18,427
Oh, my wizard-god!

1503
01:27:18,767 --> 01:27:21,027
Not so fast! Petrificus totalus!

1504
01:27:21,817 --> 01:27:23,627
Professor Quirrell, you just killed Cedric!

1505
01:27:24,337 --> 01:27:28,087
Not I, Potter. But perhaps
you'd like to see who did.

1506
01:27:28,727 --> 01:27:31,047
He's dying to see you!

1507
01:27:36,157 --> 01:27:40,597
Harry Potter, the Boy Who Lived!

1508
01:27:41,187 --> 01:27:43,367
It's good to see you again!

1509
01:27:43,627 --> 01:27:46,627
The cauldron is ready, my Loooooord!

1510
01:27:47,167 --> 01:27:49,307
Cauldron? What are you gonna do,
eat me? That's gross!

1511
01:27:49,607 --> 01:27:52,887
As delicious a dish as I think
you would make, Potter,...

1512
01:27:53,377 --> 01:27:57,307
... I'd need a stomach of my own
to digest you.

1513
01:27:57,597 --> 01:27:59,297
But I haven't got one of those...

1514
01:27:59,877 --> 01:28:00,957
yet!

1515
01:28:01,877 --> 01:28:05,957
Bone of the father,
unknowingly given.

1516
01:28:06,100 --> 01:28:09,757
You will renew your son!

1517
01:28:11,500 --> 01:28:15,757
Flesh of the servant,
willfully given.

1518
01:28:16,100 --> 01:28:19,757
You will revive your master!

1519
01:28:35,800 --> 01:28:39,957
Blood of the enemy,
forcibly taken.

1520
01:28:40,100 --> 01:28:43,757
You will resurrect your foe!

1521
01:28:45,977 --> 01:28:47,497
Detention, Potter!

1522
01:28:47,767 --> 01:28:51,687
Detention?!? God, this guy is almost
being as big an asshole as snape is!

1523
01:28:58,537 --> 01:28:59,717
It worked!

1524
01:28:59,937 --> 01:29:02,817
The Dark Lord is risen!

1525
01:29:47,187 --> 01:29:49,557
When I was a boy

1526
01:29:50,657 --> 01:29:53,037
An orphan boy

1527
01:29:54,357 --> 01:29:57,487
I'd love to move my feet

1528
01:29:58,747 --> 01:30:00,567
I'd hear a tune

1529
01:30:01,347 --> 01:30:03,407
and start to swoon

1530
01:30:04,287 --> 01:30:08,327
My life would seem complete

1531
01:30:09,507 --> 01:30:12,517
The other boys would laugh and jeer

1532
01:30:13,567 --> 01:30:17,177
But I'd catch 'em tappin' their toes

1533
01:30:17,937 --> 01:30:20,837
And when I'd start to sway

1534
01:30:21,717 --> 01:30:24,787
they'd get carried away.

1535
01:30:26,107 --> 01:30:31,947
And oh, how the feeling grows!

1536
01:30:33,587 --> 01:30:39,267
I'd take my foot

1537
01:30:41,887 --> 01:30:44,437
My little foot

1538
01:30:47,027 --> 01:30:49,627
And with that foot

1539
01:30:52,117 --> 01:30:55,457
Oh, how I'd start to shake

1540
01:30:55,677 --> 01:30:57,317
I'd take two feet

1541
01:30:58,587 --> 01:31:00,067
Two tiny feet

1542
01:31:01,367 --> 01:31:02,817
Hey look! That's neat!

1543
01:31:03,877 --> 01:31:06,067
It's coming true

1544
01:31:07,367 --> 01:31:10,977
Oh boy, I get to dance again! Woohoo!

1545
01:31:12,307 --> 01:31:15,257
To dance again

1546
01:31:15,477 --> 01:31:17,867
I've been waiting all these years

1547
01:31:18,007 --> 01:31:19,997
To dance again

1548
01:31:20,907 --> 01:31:23,277
Now, at once, a chance appears

1549
01:31:23,507 --> 01:31:25,837
to hear the beat, so on your feet

1550
01:31:26,187 --> 01:31:29,267
It's time to dance again!

1551
01:31:30,077 --> 01:31:32,757
C'mon Potter! Imperio!

1552
01:31:33,257 --> 01:31:34,697
You take your foot

1553
01:31:35,777 --> 01:31:37,377
Your little foot

1554
01:31:38,817 --> 01:31:40,177
Hey look! Your foot!

1555
01:31:41,367 --> 01:31:43,797
See how it starts to shake

1556
01:31:44,077 --> 01:31:45,387
Ooh try his arms!

1557
01:31:46,857 --> 01:31:48,387
How bout a twirl!

1558
01:31:49,517 --> 01:31:50,917
He's like a girl!

1559
01:31:51,927 --> 01:31:55,167
How overdue!

1560
01:31:55,427 --> 01:31:57,897
I get to finally dance again with you!

1561
01:32:00,677 --> 01:32:03,097
To dance again!

1562
01:32:03,737 --> 01:32:05,877
I've (you've) been waiting all these years

1563
01:32:06,127 --> 01:32:08,017
To dance again

1564
01:32:08,757 --> 01:32:11,007
Now at once a chance appears

1565
01:32:11,267 --> 01:32:13,837
It's lovely swaying, and the music's playing

1566
01:32:14,297 --> 01:32:17,667
So come on! Let's dance again!

1567
01:32:18,327 --> 01:32:19,747
Everybody!

1568
01:32:21,877 --> 01:32:23,747
I take my foot!

1569
01:32:24,157 --> 01:32:25,317
(You take your foot)

1570
01:32:25,847 --> 01:32:27,287
My little foot!

1571
01:32:27,747 --> 01:32:29,057
(Take that little foot!)

1572
01:32:29,507 --> 01:32:31,287
And oh my foot!

1573
01:32:31,477 --> 01:32:32,887
(Let me hear it now!)

1574
01:32:33,427 --> 01:32:35,997
Look how it starts to shake

1575
01:32:36,757 --> 01:32:38,057
Oh, Voldy's back

1576
01:32:38,467 --> 01:32:39,677
(Hello world!)

1577
01:32:39,987 --> 01:32:41,257
For the attack

1578
01:32:41,747 --> 01:32:42,937
(I'm gonna getcha!)

1579
01:32:43,747 --> 01:32:47,177
He'll take over the world, it's true

1580
01:32:47,857 --> 01:32:50,757
But first there's something he's gotta do

1581
01:32:51,077 --> 01:32:54,077
I'll dance again!
He'll dance again!

1582
01:32:55,547 --> 01:32:58,697
I've been waiting all these years
He's been waiting all these years

1583
01:32:58,997 --> 01:33:02,077
To dance again

1584
01:33:02,907 --> 01:33:06,027
Now at once a chance appears

1585
01:33:06,177 --> 01:33:11,607
Everybody make way
for a pas de bourre [dance-move]

1586
01:33:12,127 --> 01:33:14,767
It's time to dance

1587
01:33:15,067 --> 01:33:17,587
It's time to dance

1588
01:33:17,997 --> 01:33:28,687
Its time to dance again!

1589
01:33:39,006 --> 01:33:40,416
Yes! Ahm...

1590
01:33:40,766 --> 01:33:41,696
My dark Lord!

1591
01:33:42,086 --> 01:33:43,616
You look fabulous!

1592
01:33:43,996 --> 01:33:46,656
Belatrix Lestrange...

1593
01:33:46,946 --> 01:33:50,576
Oh, my Liege. Now it's going to be
like the old days when we did
nothing but torture,...

1594
01:33:50,876 --> 01:33:51,776
murder,...

1595
01:33:52,096 --> 01:33:53,016
and make love!

1596
01:33:54,856 --> 01:33:56,736
The old days are back, baby!

1597
01:33:59,696 --> 01:34:01,656
I can't tell you what it was like without you!

1598
01:34:01,966 --> 01:34:03,766
Well, I'm never going again!

1599
01:34:04,116 --> 01:34:05,676
'Cause I've conquered death!

1600
01:34:06,276 --> 01:34:10,246
And my first pleasure will be to
KILL Harry Potter!

1601
01:34:11,286 --> 01:34:14,656
Then next: to take over
the ministry of magic,...

1602
01:34:15,006 --> 01:34:18,266
and rule the World - FOR ALL TIME!

1603
01:34:19,826 --> 01:34:21,086
And you will, my lord!

1604
01:34:21,396 --> 01:34:22,286
But not yet!

1605
01:34:22,526 --> 01:34:23,866
For now, we must stick to the plan.

1606
01:34:24,176 --> 01:34:26,506
We blame Potter's murder on Quirrell.

1607
01:34:26,776 --> 01:34:28,936
So that your return may remain a secret.

1608
01:34:29,446 --> 01:34:32,586
The Death Eaters aren't prepared
to take on the entire ministry of magic.

1609
01:34:32,776 --> 01:34:35,366
Much less Dumbledore and
the Order of the Phoenix.

1610
01:34:35,926 --> 01:34:36,846
I'm sorry!

1611
01:34:37,416 --> 01:34:40,396
What was that about me going to
Azkaban for Potter's murder?

1612
01:34:40,646 --> 01:34:44,536
Oh ho! You show refer to him as my lord,
my Liege or my dark lord!

1613
01:34:44,866 --> 01:34:46,856
Oh no, no, no....
Bellatrix - it's.. it's ah.. it's cool!

1614
01:34:49,516 --> 01:34:51,096
Quirell is cool! Quirell is cool! He is...

1615
01:34:51,726 --> 01:34:55,226
Over the last year, he has proven
himself to be a very good fr...

1616
01:35:01,196 --> 01:35:03,846
A very good servant to
the will of the dark lord.

1617
01:35:05,456 --> 01:35:09,906
Oh, I see so - so your time is deficit and I'm
your "Sally Hemings", is that right?
[She was a slave to Thomas Jefferson]

1618
01:35:10,156 --> 01:35:11,146
No!

1619
01:35:11,576 --> 01:35:13,366
No Quirrell, that - ah...

1620
01:35:13,796 --> 01:35:16,246
That came out wrong. It's not like that.

1621
01:35:17,356 --> 01:35:18,106
Isn't it?

1622
01:35:18,436 --> 01:35:20,436
Oh, silence slave! Crucio!

1623
01:35:20,796 --> 01:35:23,056
Oh no, no, no!

1624
01:35:25,766 --> 01:35:26,846
What's the matter?

1625
01:35:27,126 --> 01:35:29,706
He's your pawn. You are his queen.

1626
01:35:32,926 --> 01:35:36,846
It is an honor to serve the dark lord.
NO MATTER WHAT'S THE TASK!

1627
01:35:42,176 --> 01:35:43,256
Are you alright?

1628
01:35:47,736 --> 01:35:50,306
Did you really know the whole time you'd...

1629
01:35:50,566 --> 01:35:51,996
blame Potter's murder on me?

1630
01:35:52,996 --> 01:35:55,796
Yyyes! Yes - ah...

1631
01:35:56,076 --> 01:35:57,216
...I knew.

1632
01:35:58,226 --> 01:36:00,766
But things have changed over the last year.
I feel different for you now!

1633
01:36:00,766 --> 01:36:01,776
Don't touch me!
But things have changed over the last year.
I feel different for you now!

1634
01:36:04,746 --> 01:36:06,806
I can explain this. It's...

1635
01:36:07,616 --> 01:36:09,436
It's like that movie: "She's all that".

1636
01:36:10,166 --> 01:36:12,546
We watched that together. - Quirrell:

1637
01:36:14,476 --> 01:36:17,876
Remember how at the end
Freddie Price Jr. turns out to be good.

1638
01:36:19,376 --> 01:36:26,926
No! I didn't see the end because
you were watching it while you were on
the back of my head, sucking my soul!

1639
01:36:28,976 --> 01:36:30,796
Well, I wish there was another way.

1640
01:36:32,376 --> 01:36:34,246
But I've got to take over the world!

1641
01:36:34,336 --> 01:36:35,446
Oh there is!

1642
01:36:38,356 --> 01:36:40,486
I let you know now that it's gonna be...

1643
01:36:40,766 --> 01:36:43,776
pretty hard to make that
rollerblading date from Azkaban.

1644
01:36:44,036 --> 01:36:45,586
Deatheaters: take him away!

1645
01:36:50,626 --> 01:36:53,616
And now you have what you waited
for for so long.

1646
01:36:55,076 --> 01:36:55,716
What?

1647
01:36:56,616 --> 01:36:58,696
Your chance to kill Harry Potter!

1648
01:37:00,396 --> 01:37:02,096
Yees!

1649
01:37:02,496 --> 01:37:03,906
Kill Potter!

1650
01:37:04,206 --> 01:37:05,346
Ava...woah! Where d'you go?

1651
01:37:06,396 --> 01:37:08,306
You won't kill me today Voldemort.
But I tell you what:

1652
01:37:08,626 --> 01:37:09,916
I'll get you some punch!

1653
01:37:23,046 --> 01:37:26,196
Oh my Rowling!
What happened, Harry Potter?

1654
01:37:26,716 --> 01:37:29,626
Harry, what the hell are you doing over here?
You missed the raffle!

1655
01:37:29,856 --> 01:37:32,156
What happened to the graveyard? Uhm...!

1656
01:37:32,476 --> 01:37:36,196
It's - it's  Voldemort! It's Voldemort!
He is back!

1657
01:37:50,852 --> 01:37:54,112
Extra! Extra! Read all about it!

1658
01:37:54,382 --> 01:37:58,172
Harry Potter, the boy who beat
Voldemort now says he's back?

1659
01:37:58,742 --> 01:38:02,032
Daily Prophet!
Get your Daily Prophet here!

1660
01:38:02,312 --> 01:38:05,132
Harry Potter vs. Voldemort, round two!

1661
01:38:05,752 --> 01:38:09,182
Minister of magic Cornelius Fudge
makes a statement!

1662
01:38:10,032 --> 01:38:15,362
I've heard these Voldemort-rumors
and I for once simply don't believe it.

1663
01:38:15,882 --> 01:38:20,032
Voldemort talks about it on his new
"Floo-Tube" channel!

1664
01:38:22,672 --> 01:38:25,922
I'm gonna find Harry Potter and
I'm gonna [peep] to his [peep]!

1665
01:38:29,712 --> 01:38:32,312
Also there's a review on: 17 again.
[A movie with Zac Efron]

1666
01:38:32,672 --> 01:38:35,022
Well, it a little slow at the beginning,
but hey...

1667
01:38:35,622 --> 01:38:39,062
Come on! Zac Efron,  Zefron, enough said.

1668
01:38:39,572 --> 01:38:42,332
I've seen these so called "Posts",

1669
01:38:42,532 --> 01:38:44,432
and I still don't believe it!

1670
01:38:44,692 --> 01:38:48,802
This is a ruse! You've all
been hoodwinked!

1671
01:38:49,942 --> 01:38:54,342
Professor Quirrell confesses the murder
of Hogwarts student Cedric Diggory!

1672
01:38:54,452 --> 01:38:56,812
Receives life in Azkaban!

1673
01:38:57,042 --> 01:39:01,942
Extra! Extra! Read all about it! Extra!...

1674
01:39:20,112 --> 01:39:21,572
This totally sucks, man!...

1675
01:39:21,842 --> 01:39:23,412
This is horrible!

1676
01:39:26,242 --> 01:39:29,342
Yeah, I know. I mean...
Look at this it's... it's terrible.

1677
01:39:29,632 --> 01:39:31,712
Harry Potter vs. Voldemort,
the fight of the century...

1678
01:39:32,002 --> 01:39:33,852
No, it's not THAT! It's Hermione.

1679
01:39:35,412 --> 01:39:36,762
It's just like...

1680
01:39:37,662 --> 01:39:38,702
I can't get her out of my head

1681
01:39:39,002 --> 01:39:42,182
and every time I look at her
I have these pains in my chest

1682
01:39:42,452 --> 01:39:45,012
and I just know it's her fault,
that bitch...!

1683
01:39:49,822 --> 01:39:51,922
I'm just not cut out for this, Harry.
I'm not!

1684
01:39:52,202 --> 01:39:54,902
Yeah man, I know what you mean.
It's like when you try to save the world
and the whole world is just against you...

1685
01:39:55,212 --> 01:39:57,382
No! No! No! No! No!

1686
01:39:58,072 --> 01:39:59,402
This isn't about you!

1687
01:40:00,702 --> 01:40:03,622
Why does every conversation we have
to have , have to turn into a Potter-talk?

1688
01:40:03,862 --> 01:40:04,502
It's not Potter-talk...

1689
01:40:04,702 --> 01:40:06,132
No! No, I'm miserable!

1690
01:40:07,892 --> 01:40:10,702
And all you can do, is talk about yourself!

1691
01:40:11,742 --> 01:40:13,412
You're like the most self obsorbed
guy I know!

1692
01:40:13,562 --> 01:40:17,022
If you where miserable, I'd be there
for you, but you won't even listen
to me, and I'm sick of it!

1693
01:40:18,902 --> 01:40:22,232
So...so...so good luck with whatever
you were talking about,

1694
01:40:22,772 --> 01:40:25,922
And I hope that you and Voldemort
live happily ever after.

1695
01:40:26,142 --> 01:40:28,952
ME, I'm never going to be happy again!

1696
01:40:32,132 --> 01:40:36,042
So I'm just gonna go curl up in my
sock drawer and sleep for days!

1697
01:40:37,622 --> 01:40:38,252
Ron...

1698
01:40:38,522 --> 01:40:39,692
Were you just talking to Ron?

1699
01:40:39,812 --> 01:40:40,812
Yeah, I was trying to
tell him about Voldemort...

1700
01:40:40,992 --> 01:40:41,842
Well did he say anything about me?

1701
01:40:42,522 --> 01:40:44,412
Ah...Yeah,...he said - ah...

1702
01:40:44,752 --> 01:40:48,292
Was one of them an apology for
how he treated me at the Yule-Ball?

1703
01:40:48,712 --> 01:40:51,982
Yeah, I heard about that. Listen,
I was wondering, if you heard about
little something

1704
01:40:52,162 --> 01:40:53,762
I remember: Voldemort is back,

1705
01:40:54,052 --> 01:40:55,612
Cedric Diggory is dead,

1706
01:40:55,792 --> 01:40:57,012
Professor Quirrell is crazy

1707
01:40:57,222 --> 01:40:58,812
and now I have to save the world!
Did you hear that, Hermione?!?

1708
01:40:59,252 --> 01:41:01,762
Actually I have heard those things,
Harry, about a thousand times.

1709
01:41:02,052 --> 01:41:04,802
But never have they been told
to me with so much sazz!

1710
01:41:05,972 --> 01:41:07,572
Love the attitude, Harry Potter.

1711
01:41:08,872 --> 01:41:11,022
You're acting like Garfield on a Monday!

1712
01:41:15,592 --> 01:41:18,162
Don't you think I have a right
to be a little stressed out?!?

1713
01:41:18,512 --> 01:41:20,352
Wha... No! No, I don't!

1714
01:41:20,642 --> 01:41:22,742
You know what, this is just like
with the dragon, okay?

1715
01:41:22,922 --> 01:41:27,172
I stressed out, I told you to prepare
and yet you didn't do anything
and you were fine!

1716
01:41:27,382 --> 01:41:28,872
You know, you just played
a little guitar!

1717
01:41:29,072 --> 01:41:31,172
I mean, I don't know what
you're crying about, Harry.

1718
01:41:31,332 --> 01:41:34,932
This is just like when you defeated...
defeated Voldemort and you were a baby!

1719
01:41:35,332 --> 01:41:36,052
Hermione, come on...

1720
01:41:36,052 --> 01:41:38,932
You're the friend that's supposed to
tell me to go to the library and
trying figure that stuff out...

1721
01:41:39,162 --> 01:41:41,292
You know what, Harry? 
I don't do that anymore!

1722
01:41:42,272 --> 01:41:42,862
What...?!?

1723
01:41:44,322 --> 01:41:46,722
Read it and weep, Potter!

1724
01:41:47,602 --> 01:41:49,502
I've heard Voldemort's back.

1725
01:41:55,802 --> 01:41:59,462
And he's trying to kill you, what do
you think of that, MOON SHOES?

1726
01:42:00,642 --> 01:42:03,822
Malfoy, I unsucceded, I don't see why
you're so happy about this.

1727
01:42:04,012 --> 01:42:05,872
If Voldemort is back- which he is -

1728
01:42:06,112 --> 01:42:07,462
you might so kiss Hogwarts goodbye.

1729
01:42:07,612 --> 01:42:09,232
You might so kiss the whole
planet goodbye!

1730
01:42:10,102 --> 01:42:12,112
Kiss the planet goodbye?

1731
01:42:12,692 --> 01:42:15,632
Having second thoughts about
Pigfarts, are you?

1732
01:42:17,392 --> 01:42:19,862
Malfoy, you're the last person
I wanna talk to right now, okay?

1733
01:42:20,122 --> 01:42:21,022
You know what?

1734
01:42:21,892 --> 01:42:25,142
As soon as you're out of the way,
I'll be the coolest kid in school!

1735
01:42:25,812 --> 01:42:28,742
Malfoy, that will never happen.
Everybody hates you!

1736
01:42:28,902 --> 01:42:31,502
Alright, okay! This coming
from Hermione "Stranger"!

1737
01:42:32,602 --> 01:42:34,472
She's right, Malfoy!
She's cooler then you!

1738
01:42:34,672 --> 01:42:36,672
Yeah, even Moaning Myrtle
is cooler then you!

1739
01:42:36,842 --> 01:42:38,232
Take this! Expelliarmus!

1740
01:42:41,882 --> 01:42:43,122
Be quiet! Be quiet!

1741
01:42:44,522 --> 01:42:45,572
Stop it!

1742
01:42:46,842 --> 01:42:49,892
What the devil is going on hereeeeee?

1743
01:42:51,962 --> 01:42:55,012
Draco Malfoy, pull those
trousers up at once!

1744
01:42:55,872 --> 01:42:57,022
Professor, I just...

1745
01:42:57,142 --> 01:43:00,302
I don't want to hear it!
I want to see you in my office!

1746
01:43:00,972 --> 01:43:02,302
NOW!

1747
01:43:05,752 --> 01:43:07,812
This is all your fault, Potter.

1748
01:43:08,232 --> 01:43:10,992
You'll pay for this! YOU'LL ALL PAY...

1749
01:43:13,652 --> 01:43:15,172
Nice - you're the man!

1750
01:43:16,042 --> 01:43:17,522
That made me feel better!

1751
01:43:25,292 --> 01:43:28,092
Hey Ginny, what's... I hope you have
something to say about Voldemort!

1752
01:43:28,772 --> 01:43:29,762
No...

1753
01:43:30,762 --> 01:43:31,542
(sigh) whatever...

1754
01:43:34,092 --> 01:43:35,072
No, I'm fine!

1755
01:43:36,542 --> 01:43:39,572
Ahm. Hey Harry?

1756
01:43:39,962 --> 01:43:40,572
Yeah?

1757
01:43:40,792 --> 01:43:45,712
So...We kissed at the Yule-Ball,

1758
01:43:46,502 --> 01:43:49,692
and...well, I thought we were
gonna be together forever.

1759
01:43:50,942 --> 01:43:52,082
But we're not.

1760
01:43:54,222 --> 01:43:57,622
Yeeaah... that, ah...
that pretty much sums it up...

1761
01:44:00,962 --> 01:44:02,092
What's going on?

1762
01:44:02,762 --> 01:44:05,422
Ginny, THIS is what's going on,
don't you get it?

1763
01:44:06,602 --> 01:44:10,402
Everyone is who... is in danger,
who's near to me. We can't be
together, because...

1764
01:44:10,602 --> 01:44:12,842
when Voldemort is back - which he is -

1765
01:44:12,962 --> 01:44:16,322
you're in mortal peril, don't you get it?
It's like the Spiderman movie haven't
you seen that?

1766
01:44:16,532 --> 01:44:18,562
MJ and Peter Parker can't be together.

1767
01:44:19,182 --> 01:44:23,032
But the whole point of Spiderman two was
that MJ und Peter Parker could be together
in the end!

1768
01:44:23,172 --> 01:44:26,812
Yeah, I know, but the point of Spiderman
three is everything sucks and it falls to shit!

1769
01:44:28,702 --> 01:44:30,272
Ginny, what I'm trying to say is,

1770
01:44:30,612 --> 01:44:33,722
I don't want my life to be like Spiderman
three, I hated that movie!

1771
01:44:36,832 --> 01:44:40,342
I'm sorry, it's just... 
that's my little way of saying, well...

1772
01:44:40,742 --> 01:44:42,052
we can't be together.

1773
01:44:43,582 --> 01:44:44,562
I'm sorry, Ginny.

1774
01:44:45,762 --> 01:44:48,042
I'm such an idiot!

1775
01:44:55,612 --> 01:44:57,412
I need a... I need a Butterbeer...!

1776
01:44:58,372 --> 01:45:00,462
Hey! Pst! Potter...!

1777
01:45:00,602 --> 01:45:01,702
Hey! It's me!

1778
01:45:02,102 --> 01:45:02,822
Who are you?

1779
01:45:03,432 --> 01:45:04,192
It's Dumbledore!

1780
01:45:06,052 --> 01:45:08,172
Listen Harry, I've got some very
important things, I got to tell you!

1781
01:45:08,342 --> 01:45:09,092
Oh, about Voldemort?

1782
01:45:09,282 --> 01:45:12,702
Yes! Things that are absolutely crucial
for you to know, but I can't get into it
right now...

1783
01:45:13,102 --> 01:45:16,502
You need to meet me in my inner office
at ten o'clock. And come by yourself!

1784
01:45:16,682 --> 01:45:21,142
Bring that...ah - invisibility-cloak of yours
and don't go blabbing your mouth about this
to anybody!

1785
01:45:21,342 --> 01:45:24,852
Voldemort has spies that could be anywhere,
even inside of Hogwarts!

1786
01:45:26,142 --> 01:45:30,412
From now on the only person you can trust,
Harry, is me and Severus Snape.

1787
01:45:32,742 --> 01:45:34,842
Listen Dumbledore, I know you
don't wanna hear this,...

1788
01:45:35,222 --> 01:45:37,942
but I am not so sure about...
Snape...

1789
01:45:38,312 --> 01:45:40,122
I think, no, I'm pretty sure,
he's working for Voldemort...

1790
01:45:40,312 --> 01:45:41,922
What?!? That's stupid! YOU're stupid!

1791
01:45:42,122 --> 01:45:46,482
No, no! I'm positive, that night in the
graveyard some Deatheater cuts
off his hand,

1792
01:45:46,762 --> 01:45:47,792
and Snape shows up without a hand.
What is that.

1793
01:45:48,162 --> 01:45:53,152
Oh Cockemamy Snape has assured me that
he lost his hand in an entirely unrelated
incident.

1794
01:45:53,712 --> 01:45:55,532
Dumbledore, why do you trust
Snape so much?

1795
01:45:55,702 --> 01:45:56,632
Because I love him!

1796
01:45:58,662 --> 01:46:05,272
Severus Snape and I share a kind of love
that i don't think you will ever fully understand

1797
01:46:07,779 --> 01:46:09,299
I would give him the clothes of my back.

1798
01:46:10,979 --> 01:46:12,299
I would share a bed with him!

1799
01:46:13,179 --> 01:46:17,299
If a snake bit him,
I would suck out the poison!

1800
01:46:17,879 --> 01:46:21,299
Even if the snake happend to accidentally
bite him on the wiener.

1801
01:46:25,179 --> 01:46:28,299
Harry i know you won't understand what
I'm talking about.

1802
01:46:28,379 --> 01:46:32,799
Maybe, maybe one day you will be able 
to find this kind of love for yourself.

1803
01:46:33,162 --> 01:46:33,772
But Professor, I...

1804
01:46:33,922 --> 01:46:35,622
Hey! I don't want to hear anything
else about it!

1805
01:46:35,832 --> 01:46:41,122
There's no way, that Severus Snape is, was
or ever shall be a servant of Voldemort!

1806
01:46:42,279 --> 01:46:44,799
All hail, Voldemoooort!

1807
01:46:46,629 --> 01:46:48,789
Severus Snape, what are you doing here?

1808
01:46:49,209 --> 01:46:51,679
Got tired of being on Dumbledores lap?

1809
01:46:52,419 --> 01:46:55,069
I ought to Jelly-legs-jinx you right now,
traitor!

1810
01:46:55,199 --> 01:46:58,669
Don't be goofy with me!
I need to see Voldemort.

1811
01:46:59,239 --> 01:47:02,639
How do we know this isn't some
Order of the Phoenix practical joke?

1812
01:47:02,769 --> 01:47:06,129
I thought you deserted the Death Eaters
when the dark lord lost his body.

1813
01:47:06,359 --> 01:47:09,689
Or were you always a spy for Dumblebore...

1814
01:47:10,079 --> 01:47:11,819
Slumbersnore!

1815
01:47:11,969 --> 01:47:12,829
Bumblesore!

1816
01:47:14,259 --> 01:47:17,159
I heard you had your dark mark
laser surgically removed.

1817
01:47:17,879 --> 01:47:22,549
Oh! Well, if you two know soooo much
about me, you should write a
bioooography!

1818
01:47:22,969 --> 01:47:25,539
Snape, the double agent!

1819
01:47:27,199 --> 01:47:28,499
That's right!

1820
01:47:28,769 --> 01:47:30,769
I've always been a servant of Voldemort.

1821
01:47:31,079 --> 01:47:34,449
I've simply been working undercover
finding out valuable informations

1822
01:47:34,899 --> 01:47:36,889
such as the inner workings of Hogwarts,

1823
01:47:37,119 --> 01:47:39,339
the roster of the Order of the Phoenix,

1824
01:47:39,999 --> 01:47:42,209
and finding out exactly what a true
Hufflepuff is anyway...

1825
01:47:43,699 --> 01:47:46,229
I've seen things, no Slytherin should see.

1826
01:47:46,599 --> 01:47:49,699
So if you're done putting each others
feet in each others mouths:

1827
01:47:49,999 --> 01:47:51,919
I would like to see my master!

1828
01:47:52,599 --> 01:47:54,039
Of course. Right away, Severus.

1829
01:47:54,299 --> 01:47:56,609
Good. I'll be in the drawing room.

1830
01:47:57,439 --> 01:48:00,109
Painting a picture of the stupid
looks on your faces...

1831
01:48:02,909 --> 01:48:05,489
Then, after sneaking into the
department of mysteries,

1832
01:48:05,629 --> 01:48:06,599
Excuse me...!
we'll enchant the...

1833
01:48:06,739 --> 01:48:08,419
Wooooooooh!Woooh!

1834
01:48:08,989 --> 01:48:10,919
WOHOHO! EXCUSE ME!

1835
01:48:11,489 --> 01:48:12,999
I was in the middle of plotting! ...

1836
01:48:14,399 --> 01:48:15,639
Where was I?

1837
01:48:16,969 --> 01:48:22,009
The statues will occupy the guards in
the the main Lobby, while you and I
sneak into the ministers office,

1838
01:48:22,469 --> 01:48:27,839
where you will be ONE killing curse away
from complete control of the
entire wizarding world!

1839
01:48:28,339 --> 01:48:29,819
How does that sound, my Lord?

1840
01:48:31,379 --> 01:48:32,149
My Lord?

1841
01:48:33,329 --> 01:48:33,949
Voldemort...?

1842
01:48:41,909 --> 01:48:43,469
Ah...yeah!

1843
01:48:45,099 --> 01:48:47,499
Gringots! That's great! That's great...

1844
01:48:48,079 --> 01:48:50,359
Polyjuicepotion, always very classic....

1845
01:48:53,389 --> 01:48:54,959
I'm sorry, what were we talking about?

1846
01:48:56,239 --> 01:48:58,599
Did you hear ANYTHING of my evil plan?

1847
01:48:59,199 --> 01:49:00,449
Well, ahm...

1848
01:49:01,179 --> 01:49:05,829
the details are a little fuzzy, but...
ah, but you did have a very evil tone...

1849
01:49:06,019 --> 01:49:07,049
He's all yours!

1850
01:49:07,479 --> 01:49:09,509
What, wha... Bellatrix, come back!

1851
01:49:09,629 --> 01:49:13,579
No! It's...do...co...don't be like this...
(sigh)

1852
01:49:14,519 --> 01:49:17,439
Now TWO people are mad at me...

1853
01:49:25,909 --> 01:49:27,669
What?

1854
01:49:28,559 --> 01:49:32,129
Sir, Severus Snape is at the door and
impertunes access to you.

1855
01:49:32,279 --> 01:49:33,669
Severus Snape?!?

1856
01:49:34,739 --> 01:49:36,079
See him in.

1857
01:49:40,779 --> 01:49:44,059
Is that a new body, my Lord?
You look absolutely ravishing!

1858
01:49:46,049 --> 01:49:47,539
Severus...!

1859
01:49:49,049 --> 01:49:53,149
For such a super secret spy you're
a terrible liar.

1860
01:49:54,329 --> 01:49:56,369
I'm a wreck!

1861
01:49:58,739 --> 01:50:00,959
You'd better have some good news.

1862
01:50:02,249 --> 01:50:05,409
My Lord, you know how for years we
were trying to get Death Eaters...

1863
01:50:05,549 --> 01:50:06,569
Aah!Aah!

1864
01:50:09,909 --> 01:50:13,659
For years we've been trying to sneak
Death Eaters onto the grounds
of Hogwarts.

1865
01:50:13,929 --> 01:50:16,319
Well, I think I finally discovered
a way how.

1866
01:50:17,479 --> 01:50:19,459
Well, by all means, Snape, tell me!

1867
01:50:19,569 --> 01:50:21,109
I can't.

1868
01:50:21,579 --> 01:50:25,049
Can't? Tease! Why not?

1869
01:50:27,109 --> 01:50:30,119
I made an unbreakable vow not
to let any Death Eaters in...

1870
01:50:30,439 --> 01:50:31,909
Unbreakable vows! I hate those...

1871
01:50:32,069 --> 01:50:36,089
I know... but I had to do it to convince
Dumbledore of my loyalty.

1872
01:50:36,739 --> 01:50:39,319
Yes, Snape, I understand...

1873
01:50:40,479 --> 01:50:43,149
but if you can't help me, what do
you propose we'd do?

1874
01:50:43,269 --> 01:50:44,939
Well, I can't tell you,

1875
01:50:45,319 --> 01:50:47,959
but I've brought along someone who can!

1876
01:50:50,049 --> 01:50:51,759
All hail Lord Voldemort!

1877
01:50:59,919 --> 01:51:02,229
Lucius Malloys boy???

1878
01:51:02,349 --> 01:51:04,089
Draco Malfoy! Malfoy...
[Voldemort] Are you serious?

1879
01:51:06,239 --> 01:51:09,569
Help from a child! You've got
to be kidding me!

1880
01:51:10,059 --> 01:51:12,279
Don't make me laugh, I'm pissing!

1881
01:51:18,579 --> 01:51:21,219
If this homemade dark mark won't
convince you, ...

1882
01:51:24,999 --> 01:51:26,459
...then at least hear me out!

1883
01:51:30,859 --> 01:51:34,159
Okay. Okay. Okay!

1884
01:51:34,759 --> 01:51:39,139
How do you propose you get MY
Death Eaters into your little
daycare center?

1885
01:51:39,349 --> 01:51:42,979
And don't... and don't suggest
a giant slide!

1886
01:51:43,179 --> 01:51:44,899
Or a Trampoline!

1887
01:51:45,219 --> 01:51:46,769
'Cause we've already tried those....

1888
01:51:51,779 --> 01:51:52,729
The vents!

1889
01:51:53,559 --> 01:51:57,689
Your Death Eaters shall enter through
the ventilation system of Hogwarts!

1890
01:51:58,679 --> 01:52:00,739
Ah, the vents...

1891
01:52:01,949 --> 01:52:05,019
Uhm... How do we find these vents?

1892
01:52:06,019 --> 01:52:07,789
Well, I'll tell you how to get to the vents.

1893
01:52:08,839 --> 01:52:09,999
But first...

1894
01:52:16,269 --> 01:52:18,819
...we discuss the subject of payment!

1895
01:52:18,959 --> 01:52:20,429
Ah, the catch!

1896
01:52:21,069 --> 01:52:22,949
There's always a catch!

1897
01:52:24,029 --> 01:52:30,359
There's nothing in this world so cruel
and demanding as the soul of a child...

1898
01:52:33,239 --> 01:52:34,669
What do you want, Malloy?

1899
01:52:36,329 --> 01:52:37,139
I want:

1900
01:52:37,309 --> 01:52:41,459
A galaxy traversing rocket-ship with
enough fuel to get me to MARS!

1901
01:52:43,379 --> 01:52:44,899
What do you want with a rocket-ship?

1902
01:52:45,559 --> 01:52:47,359
What business do you have on mars?

1903
01:52:47,879 --> 01:52:50,039
Well, let's just say:

1904
01:52:50,589 --> 01:52:53,869
Pigfarts - Pigfarts - here I come.

1905
01:52:54,449 --> 01:52:57,009
Pigfarts - Pigfarts - yum, yum, yum...

1906
01:52:57,119 --> 01:52:58,629
No...no...no...no...no!

1907
01:52:58,759 --> 01:53:00,099
with all due respect, my Lord:

1908
01:53:00,719 --> 01:53:03,779
There's one tiny flaw in this flawless plan.

1909
01:53:05,789 --> 01:53:07,039
Albus Dumbledore!

1910
01:53:07,239 --> 01:53:09,509
Arrgh,... you're right, Snape!

1911
01:53:11,549 --> 01:53:12,599
(sigh)

1912
01:53:13,589 --> 01:53:16,769
Normally I'd say: 'I'll kill him!', but I...

1913
01:53:17,319 --> 01:53:20,099
...I haven't been feeling so evil lately...

1914
01:53:27,549 --> 01:53:30,529
So here is how it's gonna
break down, Milfoy.

1915
01:53:31,759 --> 01:53:34,059
I need your guarantee, ...

1916
01:53:34,179 --> 01:53:37,109
...that you'll lead my Death Eaters
into Hogwarts.

1917
01:53:37,569 --> 01:53:41,169
I'll simultaneously be attacking
the ministry of magic.

1918
01:53:42,659 --> 01:53:44,719
Now I need you to PROMISE, ...

1919
01:53:45,129 --> 01:53:49,689
that by the end of the siege of
Hogwarts Dumbledore will be dead, ...

1920
01:53:49,849 --> 01:53:51,359
... leave Harry Potter for me!

1921
01:53:52,409 --> 01:53:55,139
But Dumbledore - must die!

1922
01:53:57,349 --> 01:53:58,509
Do we have a deal?

1923
01:53:59,769 --> 01:54:01,119
We shall shake on it.

1924
01:54:05,099 --> 01:54:06,809
An unbreakable vow!

1925
01:54:21,649 --> 01:54:24,899
By the end of tomorrow night
Albus Dumbledore will be dead?

1926
01:54:25,269 --> 01:54:27,209
Yes. - And I'll have my rocket-ship?

1927
01:54:27,369 --> 01:54:28,819
When the technology is available.

1928
01:54:30,829 --> 01:54:33,019
And you'll have to be my slave
for a whole day, starting now!

1929
01:54:33,099 --> 01:54:34,219
Nooooo!

1930
01:54:38,429 --> 01:54:39,939
You litte shit!

1931
01:54:42,189 --> 01:54:43,389
You got me!

1932
01:54:44,429 --> 01:54:47,819
You got me! Oh, that is so embarrassing!

1933
01:54:49,019 --> 01:54:52,349
That's the second time that
that's happened!

1934
01:54:54,389 --> 01:54:56,419
That's why I hate unbreakable curses!

1935
01:54:56,959 --> 01:54:59,369
Oh, there are so many things
I'm going to have you do for me!

1936
01:54:59,559 --> 01:55:01,189
You're going to - clean my room, ...

1937
01:55:01,349 --> 01:55:02,629
and lay-off my nickles, ...

1938
01:55:02,859 --> 01:55:05,489
And you'll going to tape
'Wizards of Waverly place' for me.

1939
01:55:05,589 --> 01:55:07,119
Oh, I hate chores!

1940
01:55:07,509 --> 01:55:11,489
I'll be busy with the murder!
Slaaaaaughter!

1941
01:55:18,728 --> 01:55:20,968
Harry, why would Dumbledore wanna
meet us so late at night?

1942
01:55:21,138 --> 01:55:24,288
Well, he's got some information to tell
us about Voldemort. Did you bring the
invisibility-cloak?

1943
01:55:24,448 --> 01:55:25,108
I have it right here. I...

1944
01:55:25,288 --> 01:55:27,108
Okay Harry. This better be good!

1945
01:55:27,228 --> 01:55:30,768
I don't have a Snack AND I'm missing 
'Wizards of Waverly Place' for this, okay?

1946
01:55:31,268 --> 01:55:33,698
So what do we have to do
that's so damn...

1947
01:55:34,448 --> 01:55:35,558
Oh my God! Thank you.

1948
01:55:41,578 --> 01:55:42,448
I love Hogwarts.

1949
01:55:42,568 --> 01:55:43,348
Hogwarts is amazing!

1950
01:55:43,468 --> 01:55:43,938
You want one?

1951
01:55:44,128 --> 01:55:44,628
Yeah!

1952
01:55:47,588 --> 01:55:48,428
You know what? I am leaving!

1953
01:55:48,688 --> 01:55:50,848
Oh N-n-n-n-no! You're not!
No you're not!

1954
01:55:50,978 --> 01:55:53,018
Okay, when I said I needed your help
I meant the both of you!

1955
01:55:53,138 --> 01:55:56,658
So you guys gonna get over these...
hurt feelings before something
gets hurt, okay?

1956
01:55:57,188 --> 01:55:57,698
Come on!

1957
01:55:59,508 --> 01:56:00,498
Hello Harry.

1958
01:56:00,638 --> 01:56:03,868
Oh, damn it! I told you to come
by yourself!

1959
01:56:03,998 --> 01:56:05,028
Why d'you have to bring the fatties?

1960
01:56:05,178 --> 01:56:08,298
Dumbledore - Ron and Hermione are
my best friends!

1961
01:56:08,428 --> 01:56:10,058
And if these information is as
important as you say,

1962
01:56:10,198 --> 01:56:11,038
they have a right to hear it.

1963
01:56:11,178 --> 01:56:13,858
Well, I've been wrong before.
Get in here hot legs.

1964
01:56:14,408 --> 01:56:16,248
I was talking to Weasley!

1965
01:56:16,898 --> 01:56:17,538
Thanks!

1966
01:56:19,868 --> 01:56:22,058
Well, sorry the place is such a sty.

1967
01:56:27,378 --> 01:56:29,518
OH - MY - GOD!

1968
01:56:30,388 --> 01:56:32,988
That it a BOSS Zefron Poster!

1969
01:56:33,768 --> 01:56:34,528
It's awesome!

1970
01:56:34,728 --> 01:56:35,618
Just the greatest...

1971
01:56:35,878 --> 01:56:37,338
You know, every interview i've ever seen

1972
01:56:37,548 --> 01:56:38,548
And he just seems like...

1973
01:56:38,698 --> 01:56:41,288
... a charismatic ... ah... humanitarian.

1974
01:56:42,688 --> 01:56:44,038
You think you like him?

1975
01:56:44,138 --> 01:56:44,518
Wrong!

1976
01:56:44,668 --> 01:56:45,798
'Cause I love him the most.

1977
01:56:45,948 --> 01:56:48,008
Harry Potter loves Zac Efron more then
anybody else on the planet.

1978
01:56:50,278 --> 01:56:52,808
Anyway, no, that's not what we
talk about. We talk about Voldemort.

1979
01:56:52,988 --> 01:56:55,978
Harry's right. It's not necessarily about
Zefron. Everybody knows I like
him the most.

1980
01:56:56,218 --> 01:56:57,958
But ah,... about the dark Lord:

1981
01:56:58,138 --> 01:57:01,778
If you ah... want to defeat this guy
you're going to have to know about
horcruxes.

1982
01:57:02,038 --> 01:57:03,878
What's - ahm.. What's a horcrux?

1983
01:57:04,048 --> 01:57:07,778
A horcrux is one of the most terrifying
pieces of magic that a wizard
can create.

1984
01:57:08,218 --> 01:57:12,168
It's actually when a wizard takes a piece
of his soul and puts it into something else.

1985
01:57:12,228 --> 01:57:15,808
Like ...eh... a pair of glasses,
or a butthole for example.

1986
01:57:22,228 --> 01:57:23,608
Why would anybody ever wanna do that?

1987
01:57:23,758 --> 01:57:26,938
Harry, if you have a horcrux
you can never truly die.

1988
01:57:27,418 --> 01:57:29,998
Your body can be dead,
but your soul can live on.

1989
01:57:30,158 --> 01:57:32,168
Oh, it makes sense now, Harry!

1990
01:57:32,458 --> 01:57:35,788
Everyone knows that the night your parents
were killed, Voldemort was destroyed.

1991
01:57:35,918 --> 01:57:37,188
But somehow he survived.

1992
01:57:37,488 --> 01:57:38,448
He must have had a horcrux!

1993
01:57:38,598 --> 01:57:41,938
He didn't just have ONE horcrux.
He had SIX of 'em!

1994
01:57:42,468 --> 01:57:45,338
I've already killed the first five for you,
so don't worry about that.

1995
01:57:46,088 --> 01:57:49,148
But you guys have to find
the last one with this.

1996
01:57:50,288 --> 01:57:51,388
The sword of Godric Gryffindor!

1997
01:57:53,288 --> 01:57:54,888
Do me!
Me!

1998
01:58:00,000 --> 01:58:01,000
This is serious.

1999
01:58:01,768 --> 01:58:04,448
Godric Gryffindor was one of the
four founders of Hogwarts.

2000
01:58:04,698 --> 01:58:07,278
If anything can destroy a horcrux,
that sword is it!

2001
01:58:07,418 --> 01:58:09,668
This thing is so damn awesome!

2002
01:58:10,718 --> 01:58:12,818
Oh my god. Every wizard
should have a sword.

2003
01:58:12,968 --> 01:58:15,018
Not these stupid drumsticks!
Forget about them!

2004
01:58:20,348 --> 01:58:22,608
Okay, you know what Dumbeldore.
So we know what a horcrux is,

2005
01:58:22,738 --> 01:58:24,288
that's all well and good but how
do we find them?

2006
01:58:24,578 --> 01:58:25,788
Where are they? Where's the last one?

2007
01:58:25,988 --> 01:58:27,128
You'll find them with this.

2008
01:58:27,468 --> 01:58:28,128
Woah!

2009
01:58:28,128 --> 01:58:29,688
Looks like...

2010
01:58:30,268 --> 01:58:31,598
Looks like 'G-Unit' bling,
[G-Unit: Gangster Rapper
like 50 cent]

2011
01:58:31,738 --> 01:58:34,228
But it is actually a horcrux-seeking
medallion.

2012
01:58:34,728 --> 01:58:37,258
Wait. - That's a horcrux-seeking
medallion?

2013
01:58:37,468 --> 01:58:39,218
I... that sounds a little to convenient!

2014
01:58:39,368 --> 01:58:41,998
Oh, you've a problem with a time-turner
not with a horcrux-seeking medallion!

2015
01:58:42,188 --> 01:58:45,748
Wait - so if he has this piece of bling,
then why are Ron and I even here?

2016
01:58:45,908 --> 01:58:47,318
Yeah. Voldemort isn't any of our
business!

2017
01:58:47,658 --> 01:58:49,178
Hermione Granger:

2018
01:58:49,718 --> 01:58:53,378
When one of youz has gotz a problem,
that means all three of youz
haz gotz a problem!

2019
01:58:53,648 --> 01:58:55,998
What would Zac Efron say in
time like this?

2020
01:58:57,298 --> 01:59:01,518
"We're all in this together...!"

2021
01:59:03,298 --> 01:59:06,778
Anyway. You just gotta..- You gotta
find the horcruxes and you gotta
destroy them!

2022
01:59:06,998 --> 01:59:08,038
It's the only way that you could destroy
them, that's the only way t..

2023
01:59:08,268 --> 01:59:11,168
Kids...Oh - it must be
the Death Eaters!

2024
01:59:11,438 --> 01:59:13,478
They're coming to kill me...
Kids get your beards on!

2025
01:59:13,728 --> 01:59:14,798
We don't have any beards!

2026
01:59:14,948 --> 01:59:16,118
I thought I told you to bring beards!

2027
01:59:16,258 --> 01:59:17,338
What is with the invisibility-cloak?

2028
01:59:17,638 --> 01:59:19,168
Oh well, put that on it's like a beard!

2029
01:59:24,318 --> 01:59:25,328
Hey, are you Dumbledore?

2030
01:59:25,548 --> 01:59:28,608
No no, you see, I've got this beard on!

2031
01:59:29,338 --> 01:59:30,408
Well, have you seen him?

2032
01:59:30,738 --> 01:59:33,558
Oh... I thought I saw someone
over there by that mirror.

2033
01:59:33,778 --> 01:59:37,838
But I could just have been imagining
what it was I looked like without
this beard.

2034
01:59:38,868 --> 01:59:41,288
Alright. Everybody spread out
and look for Dumbledore!

2035
01:59:41,438 --> 01:59:43,288
He's gotta be around here somewhere.

2036
01:59:45,588 --> 01:59:48,248
Be careful with the Zac Efron Poster-
it's an antique!

2037
01:59:49,068 --> 01:59:51,108
Why do you care so much about Zefron?

2038
01:59:51,228 --> 01:59:54,248
I just appreciate his charms...
 And hair.

2039
01:59:54,478 --> 01:59:55,678
Yeah. But everybody knows, that I
like him the best!

2040
01:59:56,048 --> 01:59:56,948
- What was that?
- Shut up!

2041
01:59:58,518 --> 02:00:01,498
I wish that I could say, that..
it was me.

2042
02:00:01,778 --> 02:00:03,978
Because I feel, that I love Zefron
the most.

2043
02:00:04,828 --> 02:00:07,348
But it was definitely a voice from
within this room.

2044
02:00:09,238 --> 02:00:10,758
Is it an invisible man?

2045
02:00:10,908 --> 02:00:12,378
Could The Predator be in the room?

2046
02:00:15,318 --> 02:00:17,738
Begin invisible-man-search!

2047
02:00:21,108 --> 02:00:24,258
Alright! It's me! It's Dumbledore!

2048
02:00:25,108 --> 02:00:27,228
Dumbledore? Where do you come from?

2049
02:00:27,228 --> 02:00:28,978
The man with the beard turned me in.

2050
02:00:30,078 --> 02:00:31,728
Now we've got you right
where we want you!

2051
02:00:31,858 --> 02:00:34,948
Yes. But what I don't
understand is how!

2052
02:00:35,208 --> 02:00:37,448
We had the help of a man on the inside.

2053
02:00:37,658 --> 02:00:41,128
Someone you trusted.
Someone you may have even loved!

2054
02:00:41,328 --> 02:00:41,868
Slughorn?

2055
02:00:42,118 --> 02:00:42,558
Lockhart?

2056
02:00:42,698 --> 02:00:43,918
Aberforth, my brother?

2057
02:00:44,118 --> 02:00:44,608
No!

2058
02:00:45,548 --> 02:00:46,508
It was me!

2059
02:00:47,698 --> 02:00:49,878
Malfoy, ya little shit!

2060
02:00:54,968 --> 02:00:57,488
That's right, Dumbledore.
I betrayed everyone!

2061
02:00:58,028 --> 02:00:59,278
And now I'm going to kill you!

2062
02:00:59,528 --> 02:01:03,138
Oh no, you're not, Draco. If you were
gonna to kill me, you would have done
so already!

2063
02:01:03,318 --> 02:01:06,188
No, no, no! Not necessarily true!

2064
02:01:06,388 --> 02:01:09,338
I just wanted to offer you one more
game of connect four before I
offed you!

2065
02:01:10,678 --> 02:01:12,618
Draco, there are other options.

2066
02:01:12,788 --> 02:01:16,918
You know, it is time that you look inside
yourself and figured out, what it is that
you really want.

2067
02:01:18,518 --> 02:01:20,778
I want Hermione Granger-
and a rocket-ship.

2068
02:01:22,808 --> 02:01:26,538
Then why don't you just take the girl
out for a happy meal then go to
space-camp.

2069
02:01:26,698 --> 02:01:27,278
Come on!

2070
02:01:27,428 --> 02:01:30,188
Murder leads to a life of despair and
desperation.

2071
02:01:31,038 --> 02:01:34,168
I know, you're gonna do the right thing,
eh? - Atta boy!

2072
02:01:35,308 --> 02:01:37,188
What the devil is going on heeeeere?

2073
02:01:37,418 --> 02:01:38,898
Severus, thank you!

2074
02:01:39,908 --> 02:01:41,798
We've got Dumbledore cornered!

2075
02:01:42,448 --> 02:01:44,438
Well, what are we waiting for?

2076
02:01:44,608 --> 02:01:46,438
Kill him! Do it, Draco!

2077
02:01:47,138 --> 02:01:49,178
Uh... I... I don't think, I can...!

2078
02:01:49,318 --> 02:01:51,208
Coward! 10 points from Gryffindor!

2079
02:01:51,498 --> 02:01:52,558
Severus!?!

2080
02:01:53,928 --> 02:01:56,968
I don't understand! I gave you my
leathermens jacket!

2081
02:01:57,928 --> 02:01:59,548
It never fit me.

2082
02:02:00,098 --> 02:02:04,288
Why didn't you tell me? I could have
shrunk it with magic.

2083
02:02:04,678 --> 02:02:07,328
Severus, please! Don't kill me!

2084
02:02:07,628 --> 02:02:09,418
Avada Kedavra!

2085
02:02:27,218 --> 02:02:29,778
I hate Snape! I hate Snape!
I hate Snape! I hate him!

2086
02:02:30,108 --> 02:02:30,868
I'm gonna kill him!

2087
02:02:30,988 --> 02:02:32,048
It's not your fault, Harry!

2088
02:02:32,268 --> 02:02:34,908
No, it IS my fault. Don't you get it?
Everybody's dying because of me!

2089
02:02:35,058 --> 02:02:37,188
First Cedric, now Dumbledore.
I can't do it anymore!

2090
02:02:37,418 --> 02:02:38,288
Come on! Let's go to the Burrow!

2091
02:02:38,388 --> 02:02:39,418
Ron, don't you get it?

2092
02:02:39,778 --> 02:02:42,298
I have to do this by myself.
I did it once when I was a baby.

2093
02:02:42,528 --> 02:02:44,978
I can't have you guys be near me.
There's too much risk!

2094
02:02:45,158 --> 02:02:46,708
We know, but we don't care about
the risk!

2095
02:02:46,908 --> 02:02:49,388
No, you don't understand..
You... you have to get away from me!

2096
02:02:49,568 --> 02:02:50,668
You can't mean that...!

2097
02:02:52,538 --> 02:02:54,558
I do! Just leave me alone!

2098
02:02:59,027 --> 02:03:01,717
Cornelius Fudge, the minister of magic!

2099
02:03:03,157 --> 02:03:05,447
I still don't believe you're back...!

2100
02:03:07,597 --> 02:03:10,337
Believe this, Fudge: Avada Kedavra!

2101
02:03:12,537 --> 02:03:15,837
Uh! - A heart-attack...surely...

2102
02:03:23,187 --> 02:03:24,627
Aaaaaah....

2103
02:03:24,847 --> 02:03:28,847
Yes! Yes! The ministry has fallen!

2104
02:03:29,057 --> 02:03:34,087
Yes! Now you're the minister...
Nay the king of all magic!

2105
02:03:41,967 --> 02:03:47,387
Oh, Voldemort... Take me right here!
Right now, right here on
the ministers desk!

2106
02:03:48,467 --> 02:03:49,907
I'm gonna get ya!

2107
02:03:51,607 --> 02:03:52,897
I'm gonna get ya!...

2108
02:03:53,807 --> 02:03:55,097
Come here, trixie!

2109
02:04:02,627 --> 02:04:03,517
Wait!

2110
02:04:03,867 --> 02:04:05,417
You wanna try something new?

2111
02:04:05,547 --> 02:04:07,027
Oh... so new...!

2112
02:04:08,087 --> 02:04:09,627
Get on the desk!

2113
02:04:16,227 --> 02:04:18,617
Now sit up - bitch...

2114
02:04:21,637 --> 02:04:23,827
Yes, command me, my Lord.

2115
02:04:52,227 --> 02:04:54,067
Aaah, mmmmh, that's nice...!

2116
02:04:55,487 --> 02:04:56,657
So what do we do now?

2117
02:04:57,567 --> 02:04:59,387
Anything we want...

2118
02:05:00,157 --> 02:05:01,687
hang out mostly...

2119
02:05:03,227 --> 02:05:04,747
we could watch a movie...

2120
02:05:05,107 --> 02:05:07,907
how's about 'She's all that'? I've
never seen the beginning of it...

2121
02:05:10,187 --> 02:05:11,657
Are you feeling okay, my Lord?!!?

2122
02:05:11,807 --> 02:05:13,557
Of course I am, Quirrell!

2123
02:05:13,817 --> 02:05:16,167
Alright, that's the dozenths time
you called me that!!!

2124
02:05:17,487 --> 02:05:19,187
No, I ah...

2125
02:05:19,557 --> 02:05:20,827
I called you a squirrel!

2126
02:05:22,317 --> 02:05:23,957
I called you a squirrel.

2127
02:05:24,587 --> 02:05:27,427
No! You're thinking about peon
we sent to Azkaban!

2128
02:05:27,537 --> 02:05:28,727
He's not a peon!

2129
02:05:30,137 --> 02:05:31,697
He's more a man then you'll ever be....

2130
02:05:33,457 --> 02:05:34,437
I can't do this.

2131
02:05:34,807 --> 02:05:38,127
If I'm going to be evil with all of you,
I need to be evil with ALL of you!

2132
02:05:38,477 --> 02:05:42,027
Evil with all of me?...Wha...
what does that mean...?

2133
02:05:42,377 --> 02:05:43,767
I'm all right here...

2134
02:05:43,937 --> 02:05:46,987
No! There are pieces of you missing!

2135
02:05:48,147 --> 02:05:50,547
Are you talking about the horcruxes???

2136
02:05:51,037 --> 02:05:54,657
'Cause if it...If it weren't for those
I wouldn't even be here right now...!

2137
02:06:07,317 --> 02:06:09,277
I can't remember dad,

2138
02:06:09,777 --> 02:06:11,827
and I can't remember mom.

2139
02:06:12,867 --> 02:06:16,017
And aunts and uncle aren't
quite the same.

2140
02:06:18,107 --> 02:06:23,077
But I had him and life seemed fair

2141
02:06:23,417 --> 02:06:29,697
yes, I had him he was here

2142
02:06:30,067 --> 02:06:32,687
to give me strength, show concern,

2143
02:06:33,057 --> 02:06:35,337
ask for nothing in return

2144
02:06:36,017 --> 02:06:38,517
say hello, talk me through

2145
02:06:38,957 --> 02:06:42,347
do the things that fathers should do.

2146
02:06:45,057 --> 02:06:50,327
And I'm missing you

2147
02:06:50,677 --> 02:06:53,187
I'm just missing you

2148
02:06:58,787 --> 02:07:00,557
There it is, he's gone

2149
02:07:00,807 --> 02:07:02,467
and he's hung me out to dry

2150
02:07:03,297 --> 02:07:05,627
the joy he said he felt, well,...

2151
02:07:05,847 --> 02:07:08,377
I guess it was a lie

2152
02:07:09,137 --> 02:07:13,857
but when I had him my life was fine

2153
02:07:14,387 --> 02:07:19,807
when I had him he was mine

2154
02:07:20,147 --> 02:07:22,627
He'd share his thoughts, be a friend

2155
02:07:23,087 --> 02:07:25,487
stick with me until the end

2156
02:07:25,967 --> 02:07:28,337
watch a movie, roller-skate

2157
02:07:28,767 --> 02:07:32,577
fill the world with fear and hate

2158
02:07:34,457 --> 02:07:39,637
And I'm missing you

2159
02:07:40,107 --> 02:07:44,417
I'm just missing you

2160
02:07:48,197 --> 02:07:50,657
Now I'm all alone

2161
02:07:51,087 --> 02:07:53,637
Now you're gone for good

2162
02:07:53,947 --> 02:07:58,937
now I'm stuck right here wishing
I understood

2163
02:07:59,347 --> 02:08:03,517
You gave me hope when my
spells weren't right

2164
02:08:05,057 --> 02:08:10,907
You gave me someone to hold
every night

2165
02:08:13,527 --> 02:08:16,357
And I'm missing you

2166
02:08:16,727 --> 02:08:19,067
I'm just missing you

2167
02:08:19,387 --> 02:08:21,957
and I'm missing you

2168
02:08:22,307 --> 02:08:24,617
I'm just missing you

2169
02:08:38,477 --> 02:08:40,827
My dark Lord, news from Severus Snape!

2170
02:08:41,297 --> 02:08:44,527
Dumbledore's dead and the Dementors
have control of the castle.

2171
02:08:45,237 --> 02:08:47,407
Hogwarts is yours, my dark Lord!

2172
02:08:47,717 --> 02:08:50,367
Aaah! Excellent!

2173
02:08:50,877 --> 02:08:52,937
Prepare my flying-machine!

2174
02:08:53,407 --> 02:08:55,767
Looks like I'm going back to Hogwarts...!

2175
02:09:00,386 --> 02:09:02,056
Haaaaaaaarryyyyy!

2176
02:09:02,626 --> 02:09:04,056
Ginny, what are you doing here?
Get out of here!

2177
02:09:04,246 --> 02:09:06,546
No, there's no place to go.
The Death Eaters are all
over the castle!

2178
02:09:06,726 --> 02:09:09,806
I know and they are looking for me.
And if they find me, they're gonna be
with you - you...you...

2179
02:09:10,086 --> 02:09:11,436
...you gonna get in trouble.
Get out of here!

2180
02:09:11,676 --> 02:09:12,606
What you gonna do?

2181
02:09:13,586 --> 02:09:15,216
I don't know Ginny! I'm not cut out
for these kind of things.

2182
02:09:15,396 --> 02:09:18,206
Oh no, you have to do something!
I don't know what you can do,
but you can do it!

2183
02:09:18,446 --> 02:09:19,556
Y..y - you're Harry Potter!

2184
02:09:19,706 --> 02:09:20,006
NO!

2185
02:09:20,146 --> 02:09:20,856
You're the boy who lived!

2186
02:09:21,016 --> 02:09:22,496
No, Ginny! You don't get it!

2187
02:09:23,106 --> 02:09:24,816
Will you guys get it! I -

2188
02:09:25,486 --> 02:09:27,076
I'm just a twelve year old kid!

2189
02:09:32,336 --> 02:09:35,356
Ginny, I'm sorry, but... I'm alone!

2190
02:09:36,346 --> 02:09:37,986
It's hopeless, alright?

2191
02:09:40,156 --> 02:09:42,636
I've been alone

2192
02:09:46,106 --> 02:09:49,896
Surrounded by darkness

2193
02:09:52,706 --> 02:09:56,346
I've seen how heartless

2194
02:09:57,396 --> 02:10:02,676
The world - can be

2195
02:10:05,286 --> 02:10:07,456
I've seen you cry

2196
02:10:11,406 --> 02:10:14,576
You felt like it's hopeless

2197
02:10:17,376 --> 02:10:20,546
I'll always do my best

2198
02:10:21,516 --> 02:10:26,906
To make - you see

2199
02:10:29,266 --> 02:10:32,226
That Harry you're not alone

2200
02:10:33,126 --> 02:10:35,226
'Cause you're here with me

2201
02:10:37,156 --> 02:10:41,156
And nothing's ever gonna take us down,
'cause nothing

2202
02:10:42,026 --> 02:10:44,856
Can keep me from loving you

2203
02:10:45,306 --> 02:10:47,786
And you know it's true

2204
02:10:48,346 --> 02:10:51,346
It don't matter what will come to be

2205
02:10:51,676 --> 02:10:56,836
Our love is all we need -
to make it through

2206
02:10:59,346 --> 02:11:02,016
Now, I know it ain't easy

2207
02:11:03,046 --> 02:11:05,086
No it ain't easy

2208
02:11:06,736 --> 02:11:09,056
But it ain't hard trying

2209
02:11:09,256 --> 02:11:11,286
So hard trying

2210
02:11:11,616 --> 02:11:14,276
Every time I see you smiling

2211
02:11:15,746 --> 02:11:21,636
And I feel you so close - to me

2212
02:11:22,406 --> 02:11:23,436
Tell me

2213
02:11:23,676 --> 02:11:26,446
That baby you're not alone

2214
02:11:27,416 --> 02:11:29,426
'Cause you're here with me

2215
02:11:31,036 --> 02:11:33,666
And nothing is ever gonna bring us down

2216
02:11:34,036 --> 02:11:38,386
'Cause nothing can keep me from
loving you

2217
02:11:39,326 --> 02:11:41,696
And you know it's true

2218
02:11:42,316 --> 02:11:45,276
It don't matter what will come to be

2219
02:11:45,716 --> 02:11:51,346
Our love is all we need-
to make it through

2220
02:11:55,686 --> 02:11:57,796
But I'm still in trouble

2221
02:11:58,616 --> 02:12:01,036
I trip and stumble - try

2222
02:12:01,196 --> 02:12:04,466
To make sense of things sometimes

2223
02:12:07,536 --> 02:12:09,636
I look for reasons

2224
02:12:10,336 --> 02:12:12,076
But I don't need them

2225
02:12:12,396 --> 02:12:18,496
All I need is the look in your eyes

2226
02:12:19,546 --> 02:12:24,816
And I realize

2227
02:12:25,426 --> 02:12:26,136
Hey Harry

2228
02:12:28,946 --> 02:12:31,336
Baby you're not alone

2229
02:12:32,176 --> 02:12:34,096
'Cause you're here with me

2230
02:12:35,856 --> 02:12:38,866
And nothing is ever gonna take us down

2231
02:12:39,466 --> 02:12:44,996
'Cause - nothing can keep me
from loving you

2232
02:12:45,856 --> 02:12:48,126
And you know it's true

2233
02:12:48,726 --> 02:12:51,556
It don't matter what will come to be

2234
02:12:52,086 --> 02:12:56,796
Our love is all we need- 
to make it through

2235
02:12:57,196 --> 02:12:57,716
Guys...

2236
02:12:58,506 --> 02:13:00,536
I'm so glad you came back.
I'm sorry I shouted.

2237
02:13:00,896 --> 02:13:04,056
It don't matter what will come to be.

2238
02:13:04,846 --> 02:13:08,786
Our love is all we need

2239
02:13:09,556 --> 02:13:12,286
To make it...

2240
02:13:13,126 --> 02:13:16,056
To make...

2241
02:13:16,376 --> 02:13:18,646
To make...

2242
02:13:19,006 --> 02:13:22,476
To make it...

2243
02:13:23,096 --> 02:13:30,606
...through

2244
02:13:43,626 --> 02:13:45,626
Now that we've got that four-part
harmony out of the way,...

2245
02:13:45,816 --> 02:13:46,996
...why don't we look for that horcrux?

2246
02:13:47,246 --> 02:13:47,676
Yeah, that's true.

2247
02:13:48,556 --> 02:13:49,656
Well, it could be anywhere.

2248
02:13:49,976 --> 02:13:52,566
If I had a horcrux, I would drop it
in the bottom of the ocean.

2249
02:13:53,136 --> 02:13:56,016
Or I would put it in the pyramid with
king Tut and all of his jewels.

2250
02:13:56,336 --> 02:14:00,066
Or I would blast it into space with a monkey,
who knew nothing about horcruxes.

2251
02:14:01,366 --> 02:14:05,176
Or it could be hidden somewhere around the
mundane british countryside.

2252
02:14:05,466 --> 02:14:07,826
Our search could entail months
of depressing camping...

2253
02:14:07,916 --> 02:14:11,046
...breaking into Gringotts and drinking
boatloads of Polyjiuce potion.

2254
02:14:12,176 --> 02:14:15,016
Well, the medallion says: that's dump!
So we're not gonna to that.

2255
02:14:16,236 --> 02:14:19,616
But it does say it's in one convenient place.
Get this: Hogwarts!

2256
02:14:20,026 --> 02:14:20,876
That's awesome. I love Hogwarts.

2257
02:14:21,106 --> 02:14:22,676
And it's even better.
It's in Dumbledore's office.

2258
02:14:22,816 --> 02:14:23,566
Ah, bitching!

2259
02:14:25,406 --> 02:14:27,436
So let's go! - Oh wait a second!
Wait a second! Hold the phone!

2260
02:14:27,776 --> 02:14:30,176
How did you get here? The Death Eaters
are all over Hogwarts.

2261
02:14:30,386 --> 02:14:31,776
Oh, I had help.

2262
02:14:32,126 --> 02:14:32,796
From whom?

2263
02:14:35,116 --> 02:14:35,806
Oh, it's over here...

2264
02:14:36,996 --> 02:14:37,706
Malfoy!

2265
02:14:38,476 --> 02:14:40,806
Oh, no, no, no! He's really nice now.

2266
02:14:41,746 --> 02:14:45,596
Oh, I - I - I just wanted to say, that song
you guys sang was really beautiful.

2267
02:14:47,476 --> 02:14:53,066
And ah... while - while I was backstage,
I was...ahm... working on my [singing].

2268
02:14:53,506 --> 02:14:59,086
And I thought, ahm... maybe if I could...
maybe I could join you, but you - wrapped
it up before I could chime in there.

2269
02:15:01,086 --> 02:15:05,196
Maybe if you're - do a reprise,
I could have a little - go at it.

2270
02:15:05,776 --> 02:15:09,436
And ahm - but as - as Ginny said:
I'm really nice now...

2271
02:15:09,786 --> 02:15:13,176
...and I just feel awful
about what happened.

2272
02:15:13,386 --> 02:15:16,716
But, I mean: could you argue that
this was my fault?

2273
02:15:16,936 --> 02:15:18,706
Absolutely - Yes - Oh yes!

2274
02:15:20,696 --> 02:15:23,526
Yeah, that would be a save argument,
ah...

2275
02:15:23,706 --> 02:15:27,206
But - let me ask you one question:

2276
02:15:27,946 --> 02:15:30,236
Do you thing - I'm happy about this?

2277
02:15:30,546 --> 02:15:33,066
Oh my god, Malfoy! Just because
you're upset doesn't mean you're
off the hook.

2278
02:15:33,356 --> 02:15:35,676
Yeah, and furthermore: you wanna kick
your own ass, or should we do it for you?

2279
02:15:36,736 --> 02:15:37,886
Oh...Aaaah...

2280
02:15:38,106 --> 02:15:42,046
Well, I guess, if you're - giving me the
option, I'll - I'll kick my own ass.

2281
02:15:43,866 --> 02:15:49,386
But first, I should teach you how to get
into Dumbledores office. It's ironically
the same way, the Death Eaters got in.

2282
02:15:49,756 --> 02:15:53,026
Okay, alright.W..w...w why don't you boys
head off to Dumbledores office, okay?

2283
02:15:53,216 --> 02:15:57,836
Ginny and I will... will take the invisibility
cloak and ah - we will see if we can contact
the Order of the Phoenix...

2284
02:15:58,086 --> 02:15:59,406
...we really haven't seen them
the whole play. So...

2285
02:15:59,736 --> 02:16:02,766
That's a good plan. Malfoy, don't touch me!
Let's get out of here! Let's go!

2286
02:16:04,286 --> 02:16:06,276
Ahm...hey! Hey, Hermione! Come here!

2287
02:16:06,696 --> 02:16:07,886
Come downstage...

2288
02:16:08,016 --> 02:16:19,206
Ah...Listen!...Ah... Shit!... Ah... alright,
ah...hey...aaah...

2289
02:16:19,546 --> 02:16:25,746
So... I've been acting like a
jerkass lately...

2290
02:16:26,586 --> 02:16:29,016
you know that...and, aaah...

2291
02:16:29,146 --> 02:16:35,496
...and I'm sorry. It's just: seeing you
dance with everyone at the Yule Ball
just made me kinda jealous, ah...

2292
02:16:35,766 --> 02:16:36,936
I was...I was jealous.

2293
02:16:37,826 --> 02:16:39,066
You were jealous?

2294
02:16:39,266 --> 02:16:40,416
Yeah, that's the third time I say
I was jealous...

2295
02:16:41,536 --> 02:16:44,536
Oh...Ro...Ro...Ron, we don't really have
to talk about this right now!

2296
02:16:44,706 --> 02:16:46,916
Well, what if the Death Eaters get us?
What if we don't come back? You know?

2297
02:16:47,496 --> 02:16:48,616
Don't say that...

2298
02:17:00,176 --> 02:17:01,116
Oh, my god...

2299
02:17:10,186 --> 02:17:11,586
Oh, no way...

2300
02:17:14,986 --> 02:17:16,216
It's blueberry.

2301
02:17:16,376 --> 02:17:17,336
Yeah, I can taste that...

2302
02:17:18,756 --> 02:17:19,896
Gotta let it settle?

2303
02:17:20,416 --> 02:17:21,396
Yeah, yeah.

2304
02:17:25,916 --> 02:17:26,976
Oh, it's ungodly.

2305
02:17:33,356 --> 02:17:34,786
Take two, take two...

2306
02:17:38,326 --> 02:17:39,076
You chew it...

2307
02:17:47,146 --> 02:17:47,926
Awesome!

2308
02:18:41,946 --> 02:18:43,516
Let's go kill Voldemort!

2309
02:19:04,634 --> 02:19:07,114
Did you guys see this Zefron Poster?

2310
02:19:07,264 --> 02:19:08,184
Yeah, we know, Malfoy...

2311
02:19:08,294 --> 02:19:09,254
We know about it...

2312
02:19:14,694 --> 02:19:16,084
Listen Malfoy, it's not
that big of a deal.

2313
02:19:16,214 --> 02:19:17,164
Can we just look for some horcruxes,
please?

2314
02:19:17,554 --> 02:19:18,194
Roger.

2315
02:19:20,924 --> 02:19:22,174
This thing, the pencil is a horcrux?

2316
02:19:22,284 --> 02:19:23,004
No. That's no horcrux.

2317
02:19:24,314 --> 02:19:24,894
No.

2318
02:19:25,054 --> 02:19:25,724
That is a horcrux?

2319
02:19:25,864 --> 02:19:26,174
No.

2320
02:19:28,314 --> 02:19:28,944
Pack of doughnuts?

2321
02:19:29,094 --> 02:19:29,394
No.

2322
02:19:29,514 --> 02:19:32,774
Those are Snacks, those are Snacks!
Is this a horcrux?

2323
02:19:33,514 --> 02:19:34,204
No, it's not.

2324
02:19:34,314 --> 02:19:36,424
Aaaaah!This could take forever!

2325
02:19:36,544 --> 02:19:38,404
The on... There are so many
things in this room.

2326
02:19:38,744 --> 02:19:40,274
And the only thing of REAL value:

2327
02:19:41,354 --> 02:19:42,414
That Zefron poster.

2328
02:19:43,524 --> 02:19:44,634
Wait a second...

2329
02:19:44,904 --> 02:19:45,444
No!

2330
02:19:45,634 --> 02:19:47,504
You think... no!

2331
02:19:48,444 --> 02:19:49,084
No...

2332
02:19:49,674 --> 02:19:52,744
Anything related to Zefron could
never be anything evil.

2333
02:20:05,464 --> 02:20:08,064
Ron! Kill it! Kill it, it's the last horcrux!

2334
02:20:08,354 --> 02:20:10,344
No, Weasley!
Don't kill it, it's Zefron!
Kill it, Ron!

2335
02:20:10,454 --> 02:20:11,784
Oh no, it's so charismatic...

2336
02:20:11,934 --> 02:20:13,594
Don't kill me.

2337
02:20:14,074 --> 02:20:15,904
I'm not you enemy...

2338
02:20:17,174 --> 02:20:18,854
Potter is the enemy...!

2339
02:20:19,144 --> 02:20:20,624
No no no, Harry is my friend...!

2340
02:20:20,964 --> 02:20:23,624
You gotta get your head in the game,
Weasley!

2341
02:20:25,674 --> 02:20:29,684
He will betray you! He will take that
which you want the most...

2342
02:20:29,804 --> 02:20:31,634
It's a lie, Ron! Don't listen to him,
he's lying!

2343
02:20:31,924 --> 02:20:34,104
I know your thoughts,
Ronald Weasley...

2344
02:20:35,164 --> 02:20:37,344
I know, what you truly desire...

2345
02:20:38,534 --> 02:20:39,874
Hello, Ron...!

2346
02:20:40,164 --> 02:20:41,654
Oh my God, Hermione you lost weight!

2347
02:20:41,964 --> 02:20:44,964
That's right! And in shape for
Harry Potter.

2348
02:20:45,294 --> 02:20:45,764
What?!?

2349
02:20:45,934 --> 02:20:46,454
Wait...

2350
02:20:47,334 --> 02:20:51,494
That's right! As long as Harry's around
you'll always be second best,...

2351
02:20:51,704 --> 02:20:55,184
least loved, but if Harry Potter
were gone...

2352
02:20:55,344 --> 02:20:57,004
then we could be together forever...

2353
02:20:57,154 --> 02:20:58,654
Ron, that's not true!
It's not true, Ron!

2354
02:20:58,844 --> 02:21:00,064
Yeah, Harry is my friend...

2355
02:21:00,184 --> 02:21:01,774
But don't you WANT me, Ron?

2356
02:21:01,904 --> 02:21:02,474
Yes...

2357
02:21:02,614 --> 02:21:04,044
Don't you LOVE me, Ron?

2358
02:21:04,184 --> 02:21:04,474
YES!

2359
02:21:04,604 --> 02:21:06,734
Then you know, what you gotta do,
Ron!

2360
02:21:06,924 --> 02:21:09,874
Yes... I must kill Harry...

2361
02:21:10,734 --> 02:21:13,434
That's right, Weasley!

2362
02:21:13,584 --> 02:21:15,474
No! No! It's a Trick, Ron!
Don't listen to her!

2363
02:21:16,094 --> 02:21:19,114
Stop it! Listen, Hermione is my best,
she's one of my best friends!

2364
02:21:19,264 --> 02:21:20,694
I'd never do anything to hurt
you or her!

2365
02:21:20,844 --> 02:21:24,104
Lies, Weasley! All lies!
You are covered in hell.

2366
02:21:24,284 --> 02:21:25,974
Ron, it's not true,
you're my best friend...

2367
02:21:26,304 --> 02:21:28,854
Kill him....KILL HIM!

2368
02:21:29,164 --> 02:21:31,164
NOOOOOOOOO!

2369
02:21:42,314 --> 02:21:43,114
Do it again!

2370
02:21:55,034 --> 02:21:57,804
If you put some tape on this, it's fine...!

2371
02:22:02,764 --> 02:22:05,784
Ron! You had me going there
for a minute, buddy.

2372
02:22:05,944 --> 02:22:08,814
Oh yeah... sorry about that, pal,
it was just...

2373
02:22:09,524 --> 02:22:14,434
everything she was saying, you know...
It felt like... I couldn't... I don't know...

2374
02:22:14,814 --> 02:22:15,364
What?

2375
02:22:17,924 --> 02:22:18,804
Even if that's...

2376
02:22:19,844 --> 02:22:22,264
how she did feel about you and me...

2377
02:22:23,434 --> 02:22:24,534
well, it wouldn't matter...

2378
02:22:27,184 --> 02:22:28,234
'cuz you're my best friend.

2379
02:22:32,204 --> 02:22:35,524
and I would never...
do anything to hurt you...

2380
02:22:39,114 --> 02:22:40,074
'cuz I love you!

2381
02:22:41,704 --> 02:22:43,154
I love you, too man...

2382
02:22:53,434 --> 02:22:55,994
Well... listen, chaps,

2383
02:22:56,404 --> 02:22:59,934
as fun as this was, I thought destroying
a horcrux would be much harder.

2384
02:23:00,034 --> 02:23:00,764
Yeah, me too.

2385
02:23:00,904 --> 02:23:04,554
So when you think about it, Horcruxes
are just kinda stupid.

2386
02:23:08,544 --> 02:23:10,074
Wands down, boys!

2387
02:23:11,334 --> 02:23:13,894
How could you idiots get captured?
You were invisible!

2388
02:23:14,054 --> 02:23:14,904
Sorry...

2389
02:23:15,034 --> 02:23:16,674
Do it, Potter, they die!

2390
02:23:17,214 --> 02:23:20,714
Well, looks like we got the backs against
the wall and nowhere to go.

2391
02:23:21,504 --> 02:23:22,664
Put your swords down and the wands!

2392
02:23:23,884 --> 02:23:25,984
Ooooh! Look at itty-bitty Harry Potter

2393
02:23:26,114 --> 02:23:28,374
giving orders to his itty-bitty
diaper friends!

2394
02:23:28,514 --> 02:23:30,424
I'm not a Baby! I'm not a  Baby,
I'm twelve!...

2395
02:23:30,574 --> 02:23:33,944
What the devil is going on heeeeeere?

2396
02:23:34,994 --> 02:23:36,224
Wow, Deja vu... i'm so...

2397
02:23:37,264 --> 02:23:38,244
Victory, Snape!

2398
02:23:39,054 --> 02:23:41,634
I love it! We have Potter
and his friends, AT LAST!

2399
02:23:41,914 --> 02:23:43,334
You are a very mean person!

2400
02:23:43,484 --> 02:23:44,664
Yeah, Dumbledore trusted you!

2401
02:23:44,804 --> 02:23:46,234
Yeah, you are a big, fat traitor,
Snape!

2402
02:23:46,364 --> 02:23:48,384
Oh! A traitor am I, Potter?

2403
02:23:48,764 --> 02:23:52,164
You're exactly right! I am a traitor.

2404
02:23:52,414 --> 02:23:55,254
Because I'm about to betraaaaay
someone.

2405
02:23:55,624 --> 02:23:57,854
Right - now!

2406
02:24:02,504 --> 02:24:03,684
Bat Bogey Hex!

2407
02:24:03,804 --> 02:24:04,334
No!

2408
02:24:07,674 --> 02:24:08,474
Expelliarmus!

2409
02:24:11,394 --> 02:24:12,474
Serpensortia!

2410
02:24:15,664 --> 02:24:17,384
Aaaaaaah!

2411
02:24:18,344 --> 02:24:20,674
My wiener....!

2412
02:24:25,374 --> 02:24:26,434
Snape! No!...

2413
02:24:26,694 --> 02:24:27,704
Don't even think about it, ...

2414
02:24:27,844 --> 02:24:30,034
unless anyone of you wants a
snake to the wiener!

2415
02:24:31,284 --> 02:24:32,954
Now come on, Potter! Come with me!

2416
02:24:33,154 --> 02:24:36,684
Only the dark Lord has reserved the right
to kill YOU! Come on!

2417
02:24:37,044 --> 02:24:37,874
Kids!

2418
02:24:38,024 --> 02:24:38,694
Mom?!?

2419
02:24:38,804 --> 02:24:39,584
Mrs.Weasley?

2420
02:24:39,704 --> 02:24:40,434
Who the hell are you?

2421
02:24:40,714 --> 02:24:44,104
I'm Molly Weasley and those are my kids!

2422
02:24:45,854 --> 02:24:47,364
Avada Kedavra!

2423
02:24:47,814 --> 02:24:49,224
Aaah! That is not fair!

2424
02:24:49,374 --> 02:24:50,874
Die, bitch!

2425
02:24:58,454 --> 02:24:59,554
Holy shit!

2426
02:24:59,864 --> 02:25:03,794
Mom, you just killed her, I thought you
were gonna tuck in her shirt or make her
do the dishes!

2427
02:25:07,424 --> 02:25:08,814
Stupid Kids!

2428
02:25:09,524 --> 02:25:12,564
Desperate times call for desperate
measures!

2429
02:25:12,784 --> 02:25:16,304
Even the unforgivable can be considered
forgivable sometimes.

2430
02:25:18,134 --> 02:25:19,534
What are you doing here?

2431
02:25:19,684 --> 02:25:21,334
I came here with the
Order of the Phoenix.

2432
02:25:21,514 --> 02:25:25,424
Lupin, Tonks, Mad-Eye Moody,
Sirius Black and your brother Fred.

2433
02:25:25,534 --> 02:25:26,414
Oh, great! Where are they?

2434
02:25:26,604 --> 02:25:27,414
They are all dead.

2435
02:25:29,364 --> 02:25:31,234
Fred? No!

2436
02:25:32,004 --> 02:25:32,754
Anyway, ...

2437
02:25:33,044 --> 02:25:36,384
just came here to save your lifes,
go back to what you were doing.

2438
02:25:36,534 --> 02:25:37,654
Disaparate!

2439
02:25:46,781 --> 02:25:50,181
Snape! Snape! Snape! Snape!
ah... Expelliarmus!

2440
02:25:50,501 --> 02:25:51,261
Die!

2441
02:25:51,891 --> 02:25:54,921
Oh no, Harry, this is not so good!
That is a coral snake.

2442
02:25:55,201 --> 02:25:57,671
And a coral snake is a highly
poisonous snake!

2443
02:25:58,701 --> 02:26:00,900
Well, someone's gotta suck out the poison.

2444
02:26:04,701 --> 02:26:07,300
No, no i'm not doing that!

2445
02:26:08,301 --> 02:26:11,671
I wish Dumbledore were here.

2446
02:26:15,201 --> 02:26:16,671
Ok, i mean... Hermoine do your thing.

2447
02:26:16,701 --> 02:26:26,671
No no, i think, i think we should just just
let Snape die, sorry, and go on with our lives.

2448
02:26:26,701 --> 02:26:28,671
What how can you say that?
He saved our lives!

2449
02:26:28,871 --> 02:26:32,381
No no Potter, he's right.
It's to late for me now.

2450
02:26:32,481 --> 02:26:38,301
Before I go, I need to tell you:
There is another horcrux.
[Star Wars]

2451
02:26:39,571 --> 02:26:41,401
How can that be?
All six have been destroyed!

2452
02:26:41,541 --> 02:26:42,921
No no! There's a seventh!

2453
02:26:43,061 --> 02:26:45,721
I really hope it's not an
Ashley Tisdale Poster, I can't do that...

2454
02:26:46,271 --> 02:26:47,691
Check the medallion!

2455
02:26:49,941 --> 02:26:50,661
It doesn't say anything...

2456
02:26:50,811 --> 02:26:52,081
Well, give it to Granger!

2457
02:26:54,341 --> 02:26:57,831
Wait, but it... it says there's one
right here, but I don't understand...

2458
02:26:58,801 --> 02:27:01,871
Harry, the night Voldemort
killed your parents, ...

2459
02:27:02,231 --> 02:27:06,581
he tried to destroy you, but his body
was destroyed instead.

2460
02:27:06,961 --> 02:27:12,131
when that happened, a part of his soul
was blasted away from the whole...

2461
02:27:12,491 --> 02:27:14,691
and attached itself...

2462
02:27:16,931 --> 02:27:17,971
...to YOU!

2463
02:27:19,911 --> 02:27:24,501
Voldemort can never truly die, until all
the horcruxes have been destroyed!

2464
02:27:24,651 --> 02:27:28,911
But if... if Harry is a  horcrux, I mean...
does Harry have to be...destroyed?

2465
02:27:29,091 --> 02:27:30,081
There's got to be another way...!

2466
02:27:30,251 --> 02:27:33,651
No. Potter, I'll show you
what you need to do.

2467
02:27:34,011 --> 02:27:36,761
Watch ... very...carefully...

2468
02:27:44,551 --> 02:27:46,301
He... he didn't even do ANYTHING...

2469
02:27:47,861 --> 02:27:49,481
That's because he's dead you
dumb mother fu...

2470
02:27:59,411 --> 02:28:01,011
People of Hogwarts!

2471
02:28:02,001 --> 02:28:04,861
My Death Eaters have taken the castle!

2472
02:28:05,541 --> 02:28:09,681
And your headmaster Albus Dumbledore
is dead!

2473
02:28:10,911 --> 02:28:16,421
Continue to resist and you will all be
killed one by one.

2474
02:28:16,971 --> 02:28:22,021
But - there need not be war between us.

2475
02:28:22,481 --> 02:28:24,881
You've all fought so valiantly ...

2476
02:28:25,291 --> 02:28:29,371
...and I'm willing to offer you positions
in my new world-order

2477
02:28:29,501 --> 02:28:30,481
as my slaves...
[without loudspeaking...]

2478
02:28:32,391 --> 02:28:34,731
Give up now and be forgiven!

2479
02:28:35,491 --> 02:28:37,921
I command my Death Eaters
to stand down.

2480
02:28:39,111 --> 02:28:43,331
Now, Harry Potter, I speak directly
to you!

2481
02:28:44,351 --> 02:28:50,901
You do not wish for those closest to you
to continue to suffer and die
on your behalf!

2482
02:28:51,241 --> 02:28:53,081
You will come face me yourself!

2483
02:28:54,291 --> 02:28:58,991
I'll be waiting for you, in the
forbidden forest, for one hour.

2484
02:28:59,761 --> 02:29:04,931
At the end of that hour you have
not come to face me, have not-
turned yourself in- ...

2485
02:29:05,711 --> 02:29:07,581
...the battle recommences.

2486
02:29:07,821 --> 02:29:12,371
This time, Potter, I shall enter
the fray myself!

2487
02:29:13,011 --> 02:29:14,171
And I will fight!

2488
02:29:14,981 --> 02:29:18,351
And I will murder every last man, ...

2489
02:29:19,181 --> 02:29:21,181
...woman and child, ...

2490
02:29:21,921 --> 02:29:24,931
who has tried to conceal you from me!

2491
02:29:26,121 --> 02:29:28,251
Voldemort out, bitches!

2492
02:29:30,671 --> 02:29:33,491
Okay...Alright guys, don't worry...we...
we still have an hour, okay?

2493
02:29:33,761 --> 02:29:35,591
We...we...we just need to
come up with a plan...

2494
02:29:36,171 --> 02:29:38,761
There's no plan, Hermione, I...
I know what I have to do.

2495
02:29:39,341 --> 02:29:40,381
I ... I have to die...

2496
02:29:40,581 --> 02:29:42,741
No, no, no, NO!
There's GOT to be another way!

2497
02:29:42,881 --> 02:29:46,521
Oh... Ma...may....maybe there's
something ah... maybe there's
something in this book!

2498
02:29:46,821 --> 02:29:50,181
Maybe we could find some sort of
enchantment, that will nullify...

2499
02:29:50,531 --> 02:29:53,631
No no no, forget about it...!
There's only one thing to do...

2500
02:29:55,971 --> 02:29:56,981
I have to die!

2501
02:29:58,561 --> 02:29:59,911
I love you all...

2502
02:30:00,731 --> 02:30:02,481
except you Draco,
I can't [peep] stand you.

2503
02:30:06,821 --> 02:30:08,061
Goodbye!

2504
02:30:08,441 --> 02:30:09,671
Harry...

2505
02:30:40,731 --> 02:30:42,451
He's not coming, my Lord...

2506
02:30:44,001 --> 02:30:45,571
It seems that way...

2507
02:30:52,131 --> 02:30:56,751
Well, Death Eaters: looks like we're
going back to seize the castle!

2508
02:30:57,251 --> 02:30:59,651
This is what Potter has chosen!

2509
02:31:02,401 --> 02:31:07,461
Funny, I... I expected him to...
I expected him to come.

2510
02:31:08,771 --> 02:31:10,201
Seems I was mistaking!

2511
02:31:11,341 --> 02:31:12,291
You weren't!

2512
02:31:16,861 --> 02:31:18,831
Harry Potter!

2513
02:31:19,231 --> 02:31:21,871
The boy who lived!

2514
02:31:24,101 --> 02:31:25,481
Crucio!

2515
02:31:29,711 --> 02:31:31,331
Crucio!

2516
02:31:37,051 --> 02:31:39,231
Are you not even going to fight back?

2517
02:31:49,281 --> 02:31:50,461
You're weak...

2518
02:31:53,051 --> 02:31:54,251
weak...

2519
02:31:55,691 --> 02:31:57,261
Just -

2520
02:31:57,451 --> 02:31:58,341
like -

2521
02:31:58,801 --> 02:31:59,721
your -

2522
02:32:00,761 --> 02:32:01,921
parents...

2523
02:32:06,851 --> 02:32:11,251
They did not deserve to live in this
world, in MY world!

2524
02:32:14,281 --> 02:32:15,671
Prepare to join them.

2525
02:32:16,811 --> 02:32:17,911
Prepare -

2526
02:32:18,701 --> 02:32:19,711
to die.

2527
02:32:20,711 --> 02:32:22,141
Avada Kedavra!

2528
02:32:28,911 --> 02:32:35,121
Yeah - woho - Voldy! Voldy!...
You did it, my Lord!

2529
02:32:35,461 --> 02:32:38,131
Potter is dead, no one shall ever
question your powers again!

2530
02:32:38,591 --> 02:32:40,201
Yes...

2531
02:32:41,191 --> 02:32:42,691
Doesn't this please you, my Lord?

2532
02:32:49,691 --> 02:32:50,701
Yeah...

2533
02:32:52,831 --> 02:32:54,991
Yeah, it's great... it's great...

2534
02:32:56,951 --> 02:32:59,861
I just thought it might make me feel
less empty inside.

2535
02:33:02,111 --> 02:33:03,661
Well Death Eaters: ...

2536
02:33:04,921 --> 02:33:08,581
We go back to Hogwarts to tell them
what has become of their  -

2537
02:33:10,071 --> 02:33:10,961
'Hero'!

2538
02:33:17,953 --> 02:33:18,983
Hey, Harry!

2539
02:33:20,503 --> 02:33:22,653
Wha... Dumbledore, wha... ?!?

2540
02:33:23,033 --> 02:33:25,963
What am I doping here? Where am I?
I thought I was dead, I got shocked
by Voldemort, I...

2541
02:33:26,183 --> 02:33:29,233
Let's just say you're somewhere
between our world and the next.

2542
02:33:29,793 --> 02:33:31,663
What?!? Did I survive??? What...w...

2543
02:33:32,093 --> 02:33:33,813
Not really the first time, Potter.

2544
02:33:34,183 --> 02:33:35,313
Take a seat.

2545
02:33:36,523 --> 02:33:37,523
Alright...

2546
02:33:38,833 --> 02:33:42,083
Harry, have you ever heard of a love-
SIT DOWN!

2547
02:33:42,253 --> 02:33:43,733
Have you ever heard of a love-shield?

2548
02:33:44,723 --> 02:33:45,583
Ah...

2549
02:33:46,113 --> 02:33:48,233
No, but it sounds kind of...
kind of fruity...

2550
02:33:48,533 --> 02:33:50,893
A love-shield is anything but fruity!

2551
02:33:51,643 --> 02:33:55,533
It's when somebody loves you so much,
that in fact they were ever willing
to give their life for you,

2552
02:33:56,113 --> 02:34:01,723
that love really becomes a shield which
surrounds your body to protect you
from any form of dark magic.

2553
02:34:02,703 --> 02:34:05,433
So... is that what happened to me?
I have a love-shield?

2554
02:34:05,703 --> 02:34:09,763
Harry, it's time for you to learn all the
things you should have known
seven years ago...

2555
02:34:09,953 --> 02:34:11,823
which really would have helped you
along the way.

2556
02:34:13,633 --> 02:34:15,923
The love-shield protected you
the first time ah, ...

2557
02:34:16,183 --> 02:34:18,573
Voldemort accidentally turned you
into the seventh horcrux , ...

2558
02:34:18,783 --> 02:34:19,803
the one not even he knew about...

2559
02:34:20,033 --> 02:34:23,013
That's when I survived the first time.
...Exactly. And when Voldemort tried
killing you this time, ...

2560
02:34:23,203 --> 02:34:26,263
he was actually unknowingly killing
a piece of himself inside of you...

2561
02:34:26,443 --> 02:34:28,163
ah... and I've known the whole time!

2562
02:34:30,213 --> 02:34:32,283
You knew this the whole time?
You're the best!

2563
02:34:32,503 --> 02:34:36,463
Hey! Hey! They don't call me the
greatest wizard who ever lived
for nothing.

2564
02:34:37,913 --> 02:34:43,593
Harry, it's time for you to get your
cute little butt back there and fight
him as a mortal man!

2565
02:34:43,993 --> 02:34:47,293
Except this time, he will be
a mortal man, too!

2566
02:34:48,993 --> 02:34:50,993
Dumbledure, i don't know...
What if... what if i can't?

2567
02:34:51,293 --> 02:34:54,393
What do you mean can't?
You gotta ??? to me Harry!

2568
02:34:54,693 --> 02:34:58,593
Harry, the true power of a wizard is not
measured in how many spells he knows

2569
02:34:58,993 --> 02:35:00,293
Or how many horcruxes he's got.

2570
02:35:01,293 --> 02:35:04,393
The true power of a wizard is right here!

2571
02:35:08,993 --> 02:35:10,293
You know what Dumbledor?

2572
02:35:11,513 --> 02:35:14,023
I care what you're saying.
I know what I have to do.

2573
02:35:14,293 --> 02:35:15,023
Good boy, good boy!

2574
02:35:17,153 --> 02:35:19,153
Hey, before I go, ahm...

2575
02:35:19,973 --> 02:35:23,213
So you're a clairvoant now, right? You
can see the past, the present and the
future, all the same time... [Oh yeah!]

2576
02:35:24,613 --> 02:35:25,963
Can you tell me how 'Lost' ends?

2577
02:35:31,543 --> 02:35:35,903
Harry, there are some questions
that even I can't answer.

2578
02:35:38,623 --> 02:35:39,343
Thanks, man!

2579
02:35:39,653 --> 02:35:41,823
Hey, no problem. Get out of here!

2580
02:35:43,233 --> 02:35:44,823
Third door on your left! Yeah.

2581
02:35:47,563 --> 02:35:49,483
Are you ready to go, Dumbledore?

2582
02:35:49,643 --> 02:35:50,993
Sure am, Rumbleroar!

2583
02:35:55,113 --> 02:35:59,463
And you're sure you don't want to 
let Harry Potter know that you're
really still alive?

2584
02:35:59,693 --> 02:36:03,943
Oh no, Pigfarts has been a closely
guarded secret for thousands of years.

2585
02:36:04,173 --> 02:36:05,933
It would be a shame to let the cat
out of the bag. No pun intended.

2586
02:36:07,053 --> 02:36:08,723
I suppose you're right.

2587
02:36:09,323 --> 02:36:11,633
Do you have your space-suit,
Dumbledore?

2588
02:36:11,943 --> 02:36:13,613
Oh! Thank you for reminding me!

2589
02:36:21,193 --> 02:36:22,593
Ready to go, Rumby?

2590
02:36:22,743 --> 02:36:25,253
I sure am! To Pigfarts!

2591
02:36:25,713 --> 02:36:28,333
RUMBLEROAAAAAAR!!!

2592
02:36:52,163 --> 02:36:53,783
People of Hogwarts!

2593
02:36:54,783 --> 02:36:56,363
It's me.

2594
02:36:57,383 --> 02:37:00,343
Harry Potter is dead!

2595
02:37:00,973 --> 02:37:05,833
He was killed while running away,
trying to save himself, ...

2596
02:37:06,393 --> 02:37:10,423
...while you layed down
your lifes for him.

2597
02:37:11,683 --> 02:37:13,753
The battle is won!

2598
02:37:14,443 --> 02:37:16,793
My Death Eaters outnumber you!

2599
02:37:17,423 --> 02:37:21,353
Continue to resist and be slaughtered!

2600
02:37:22,853 --> 02:37:24,443
Come out of the castle, ...

2601
02:37:25,013 --> 02:37:26,373
... kneel before me, ...

2602
02:37:26,933 --> 02:37:29,743
...and you may - be - spared!

2603
02:37:33,223 --> 02:37:35,263
Oh shit... Okay... aaaahm...

2604
02:37:36,113 --> 02:37:39,063
Alright, ah, you guys, you guys
barricade the door!

2605
02:37:39,203 --> 02:37:42,103
Go with ...with ah...the bench...
go, go do it right now!

2606
02:37:42,733 --> 02:37:46,453
Ahm... Cho! You...
you will see if Neville's dead.

2607
02:37:48,263 --> 02:37:51,183
Aaahm... you guys:
Ah...Go get Snacks!

2608
02:37:51,913 --> 02:37:53,253
Ah shit, we barricaded the door...

2609
02:37:55,033 --> 02:37:57,073
Me, I will... I will quit...ah, ...

2610
02:37:58,673 --> 02:38:01,123
Well, there's only one thing 
we need to do. We're gonna fight!

2611
02:38:01,503 --> 02:38:03,943
Oh, come on, I'm tired...!

2612
02:38:04,133 --> 02:38:06,093
Can't we just be Death Eaters...?

2613
02:38:07,583 --> 02:38:11,913
No! No, we can't just be Death Eaters!
Okay?

2614
02:38:17,423 --> 02:38:19,753
We're gonna fight! Okay?

2615
02:38:20,373 --> 02:38:22,863
And we're gonna fight SO HARD, ...

2616
02:38:23,973 --> 02:38:25,203
...that we're gonna win!

2617
02:38:28,363 --> 02:38:30,123
He thinks that we're finished

2618
02:38:31,273 --> 02:38:32,773
He thinks that we're done

2619
02:38:33,933 --> 02:38:36,243
He thinks that it's over

2620
02:38:36,473 --> 02:38:38,703
His battle is won HA!

2621
02:38:39,273 --> 02:38:40,943
He thinks that we're finished

2622
02:38:41,223 --> 02:38:43,623
No!
but we aren't through

2623
02:38:44,253 --> 02:38:48,743
stop and think my friends
what would Harry do for you?

2624
02:38:49,233 --> 02:38:50,773
Harry never gave up the fight

2625
02:38:51,133 --> 02:38:53,593
Harry stood up for what is right

2626
02:38:53,763 --> 02:38:58,153
Well, now its our turn

2627
02:38:58,403 --> 02:39:02,413
our turn!

2628
02:39:02,653 --> 02:39:05,393
make a joyful sound

2629
02:39:05,923 --> 02:39:08,003
Voldemort is going down!

2630
02:39:13,223 --> 02:39:14,203
We must unite

2631
02:39:14,543 --> 02:39:15,863
so we can fight,

2632
02:39:16,943 --> 02:39:19,113
turn the battle around

2633
02:39:19,513 --> 02:39:20,543
time's running out

2634
02:39:20,843 --> 02:39:22,963
it's time to shout:

2635
02:39:23,373 --> 02:39:25,363
Voldemort is going down!

2636
02:39:26,123 --> 02:39:29,043
Can't you feel a fire burning?

2637
02:39:29,413 --> 02:39:32,603
now it's time to be a man!

2638
02:39:32,823 --> 02:39:39,563
a great big muscley
super big super hot man!

2639
02:39:39,793 --> 02:39:42,293
We won't be pushed around anymore!

2640
02:39:42,693 --> 02:39:45,653
we'll be a force you can not ignore!

2641
02:39:46,043 --> 02:39:50,183
we'll be an army for Dumbledore!

2642
02:39:50,363 --> 02:39:53,353
For Dumbledore!

2643
02:39:54,923 --> 02:39:56,133
We must unite

2644
02:39:56,383 --> 02:39:57,723
so we can fight,

2645
02:39:58,893 --> 02:40:00,843
turn the battle around

2646
02:40:01,233 --> 02:40:02,303
time's running out

2647
02:40:02,793 --> 02:40:04,933
it's time to shout

2648
02:40:05,263 --> 02:40:07,213
Voldemort is going down!

2649
02:40:08,533 --> 02:40:10,103
Hey Guys! I'm alive!

2650
02:40:10,823 --> 02:40:12,953
I'm back. Guys, I know how
to defeat Voldemort.

2651
02:40:13,153 --> 02:40:14,293
Everybody follow me, okay?

2652
02:40:15,593 --> 02:40:16,693
We must unite

2653
02:40:17,063 --> 02:40:18,603
so we can fight,

2654
02:40:19,503 --> 02:40:21,393

2655
02:40:22,163 --> 02:40:23,143
time's running out

2656
02:40:23,493 --> 02:40:25,653
it's time to shout:

2657
02:40:26,053 --> 02:40:30,443
We must unite - so we can fight
Voldemort is goiiiiiiiiing...

2658
02:40:30,723 --> 02:40:32,603
Voldemort is going down!

2659
02:40:41,664 --> 02:40:43,574
No! No, no! Cho, come here!

2660
02:40:44,494 --> 02:40:46,494
It's okay we barricaded the door,
nobody can get through that it's
impossible. It's alright. It's alright.

2661
02:40:46,644 --> 02:40:47,494
That's right. It's impossible.
Impossible!

2662
02:40:51,224 --> 02:40:52,484
Avada Kedavra!

2663
02:40:53,814 --> 02:40:55,454
WHAAAAT?!?

2664
02:40:55,974 --> 02:40:57,064
Potter?

2665
02:40:57,374 --> 02:40:59,584
How many times do I
have to kill you, boy?

2666
02:40:59,714 --> 02:41:00,634
Clearly more then once!

2667
02:41:01,094 --> 02:41:03,514
But it's all over Voldemort. 
cuz you can't kill me this time.

2668
02:41:04,064 --> 02:41:04,874
Nobody help me!

2669
02:41:05,194 --> 02:41:06,194
I gotta do this by myself.

2670
02:41:06,374 --> 02:41:10,054
He doesn't mean that! It's not how
he operates, is it, boy?

2671
02:41:10,424 --> 02:41:13,444
Who're you gonna use as a human
shield this time, Potter?

2672
02:41:13,604 --> 02:41:14,864
- Ron!
- Oh!

2673
02:41:17,794 --> 02:41:19,814
Nobody! 'cuz this time it's just you
and me!

2674
02:41:20,044 --> 02:41:22,544
Means all your horcruxes are gone.
I destroyed them all.

2675
02:41:22,674 --> 02:41:23,724
WHAT?!? Ah...

2676
02:41:23,894 --> 02:41:25,384
Even my ZEFRON Poster?!?

2677
02:41:26,254 --> 02:41:27,664
Especially the Zefron poster!

2678
02:41:27,844 --> 02:41:30,304
No! Curse you, Potter!
You'll die for that!

2679
02:41:30,444 --> 02:41:31,244
No, I won't.

2680
02:41:31,394 --> 02:41:34,014
I won't. Because you can't kill me.
And you can't kill any of these people.

2681
02:41:34,144 --> 02:41:35,384
What the [peep] are you on about?

2682
02:41:37,194 --> 02:41:39,084
You don't learn from your mistakes,
do you Voldemort?

2683
02:41:39,314 --> 02:41:41,204
I was prepared to die
to save these people.

2684
02:41:41,344 --> 02:41:41,814
But you didn't!

2685
02:41:41,944 --> 02:41:42,934
Yes, but I meant to.

2686
02:41:44,554 --> 02:41:45,454
And that's what did it.

2687
02:41:45,814 --> 02:41:47,994
I've done, what my mother did for me,
for these people.

2688
02:41:48,204 --> 02:41:51,744
I've given the magical sanctuary.
So you can't hurt me or these
people ever again.

2689
02:41:52,064 --> 02:41:52,784
So what?

2690
02:41:54,184 --> 02:41:56,224
Who cares about these children?

2691
02:41:56,374 --> 02:41:58,124
It's you I want dead, Potter!

2692
02:41:58,304 --> 02:42:00,994
What's to stop you from dying
when I strike?

2693
02:42:01,144 --> 02:42:02,314
Just one thing...

2694
02:42:02,674 --> 02:42:05,534
Think about all the people you've hurt,
Voldemort, all the lifes you destroyed.

2695
02:42:05,864 --> 02:42:07,964
The people you've s...
The people you've killed.

2696
02:42:08,324 --> 02:42:10,284
Why don't you try a little slice of
remorse pie?

2697
02:42:10,444 --> 02:42:11,024
What???

2698
02:42:11,424 --> 02:42:12,734
There's got to be ONE person, ...

2699
02:42:13,094 --> 02:42:15,904
ONE thing in your life that you miss.
That you regret.

2700
02:42:19,164 --> 02:42:21,264
Well... maybe there's one...

2701
02:42:22,734 --> 02:42:23,634
NO!

2702
02:42:23,804 --> 02:42:24,614
There isn't!

2703
02:42:25,204 --> 02:42:28,164
The joke's on you, Potter!
I don't care about anybody!

2704
02:42:28,414 --> 02:42:30,904
I know. That's what makes you
such a piece of shit.

2705
02:42:32,584 --> 02:42:34,164
'cuz here at Hogwarts we all
stick together.

2706
02:42:34,654 --> 02:42:36,044
We love one another - we're friends!

2707
02:42:36,664 --> 02:42:40,224
My love's protecting these guys-
and their love is all I need to protect
me from you.

2708
02:42:42,784 --> 02:42:45,644
So let's put that theory to the test, Potter!

2709
02:42:45,854 --> 02:42:46,884
Avada Kedavra!

2710
02:42:47,024 --> 02:42:47,594
Expelliarmus!

2711
02:42:57,404 --> 02:42:59,784
Well, chocolate frogs!
Harry Potter did it ya'll!

2712
02:43:11,324 --> 02:43:17,194
Wow, wow, wow,wow,..., wow!

2713
02:43:17,804 --> 02:43:19,264
Wow, listen! Hey!

2714
02:43:19,994 --> 02:43:21,674
I just wanna let you guys know:

2715
02:43:23,224 --> 02:43:24,974
That I'm totally cool with it. Go on!

2716
02:43:26,024 --> 02:43:27,444
Come here! Let's make out!

2717
02:43:29,784 --> 02:43:32,804
Well, Guys... I mean...
I guess that ties up all the
loose ends!

2718
02:43:32,954 --> 02:43:33,694
Yeah. Everything's cool!

2719
02:43:33,884 --> 02:43:35,774
Oh, except for the
house-cup-tournament.

2720
02:43:35,954 --> 02:43:36,364
Kids kids, look at this.
[??????]

2721
02:43:37,354 --> 02:43:38,344
I found Dumbledores will.

2722
02:43:38,494 --> 02:43:39,294
Dumbledores will?

2723
02:43:39,524 --> 02:43:41,754
In case of my death, Gryffindor wins
the house-cup.

2724
02:43:43,274 --> 02:43:45,744
It's also set that Hogwarts goes to
Harry Potter, ...

2725
02:43:45,964 --> 02:43:47,714
... my Chocolate-factory goes to
Charlie...

2726
02:43:48,034 --> 02:43:49,494
...and toontown goes to the toons!

2727
02:43:52,364 --> 02:43:54,494
Hey, Guys. Well, I guess all our
professors are dead, so...

2728
02:43:55,044 --> 02:43:56,444
...butterbeer's on me!

2729
02:44:08,004 --> 02:44:08,864
You're free to go.

2730
02:44:10,914 --> 02:44:11,744
Thank you.

2731
02:44:13,494 --> 02:44:14,264
You know...

2732
02:44:14,524 --> 02:44:18,024
while I was devouring every single one
of your happy thoughts, ...

2733
02:44:18,414 --> 02:44:22,664
they all seemed to be about a certain
friend of yours. Care to talk?

2734
02:44:25,244 --> 02:44:27,344
No! No that's behind me now!

2735
02:44:28,494 --> 02:44:29,084
Sorry.

2736
02:44:29,774 --> 02:44:31,184
Well, did you hear the news?

2737
02:44:31,494 --> 02:44:33,204
Voldemort is dead!

2738
02:44:34,174 --> 02:44:37,004
Yeah! Good luck getting off this
impenetrable island!

2739
02:44:43,864 --> 02:44:44,904
Dead?

2740
02:45:21,074 --> 02:45:21,844
Hey you!

2741
02:45:28,904 --> 02:45:31,094
Voldemort, is it - is it really you?

2742
02:45:32,944 --> 02:45:34,414
What's left of me.

2743
02:45:35,864 --> 02:45:37,194
But I just heard that y...you were

2744
02:45:37,364 --> 02:45:38,484
...destroyed?

2745
02:45:41,534 --> 02:45:42,324
Yeah.

2746
02:45:50,694 --> 02:45:53,264
But Quirrell, there's - there's
a part of me,...

2747
02:45:54,324 --> 02:45:59,134
that's still here. And I can't go on
to the next plane without it.

2748
02:46:00,884 --> 02:46:02,964
It's a part of me that can't be
destroyed.

2749
02:46:03,864 --> 02:46:05,744
Because it's right...

2750
02:46:06,284 --> 02:46:06,994
...in...

2751
02:46:09,564 --> 02:46:10,164
...here!

2752
02:46:15,274 --> 02:46:16,614
In my heart?

2753
02:46:21,734 --> 02:46:22,834
So you came back?

2754
02:46:25,944 --> 02:46:27,094
I came home.

2755
02:46:38,194 --> 02:46:40,744
And you don't want to kill
Harry Potter anymore?

2756
02:46:43,574 --> 02:46:44,774
No.

2757
02:46:47,054 --> 02:46:47,994
No.

2758
02:46:49,144 --> 02:46:52,784
Because I learned something when I
had my body back, Quirrell.

2759
02:46:53,774 --> 02:46:57,534
I learned that life is...really messy.

2760
02:46:57,824 --> 02:47:02,934
complicated and... it doesn't turn
out the way that you think it will.

2761
02:47:03,794 --> 02:47:04,444
and...ahm...

2762
02:47:06,654 --> 02:47:09,614
...you think killing people might make
them like you, but it doesn't!

2763
02:47:11,634 --> 02:47:13,554
It just makes people dead.

2764
02:47:19,684 --> 02:47:22,524
I got ki...I got killed by a two-year-old!

2765
02:47:23,794 --> 02:47:28,024
And that's really embarrassing.
And everyone says: when you're gonna
come back, Voldemort?

2766
02:47:28,744 --> 02:47:32,794
When you're gonna take over the world?
It's on me. It's all on me!

2767
02:47:33,864 --> 02:47:36,524
And i'm sitting there by myself.

2768
02:47:36,664 --> 02:47:37,984
('cuz no one is there)

2769
02:47:39,404 --> 02:47:42,004
And I say to myself:

2770
02:47:45,764 --> 02:47:48,584
Maybe with Quirrell things would be okay.

2771
02:47:50,864 --> 02:47:52,994
Is 'okay' good?

2772
02:47:56,834 --> 02:47:57,974
Quirrell!

2773
02:48:00,604 --> 02:48:02,684
Okay is wonderful!

2774
02:48:14,344 --> 02:48:16,914
Baby, you're not alone!

2775
02:48:17,954 --> 02:48:19,724
'cause you're here with me

2776
02:48:21,734 --> 02:48:43,794
...
