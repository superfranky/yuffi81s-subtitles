1
00:00:01,230 --> 00:00:03,100
You son of a...

2
00:00:03,470 --> 00:00:05,590
You son of a bitch!

3
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:07,840
Joey, I'm sorry.

4
00:00:07,870 --> 00:00:08,680
No!

5
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:10,380
No, no, no! 

6
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:14,270
You dumb dick! You're ruining my life. You're ruining my whole damn life.

7
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:15,430
Well, yeah. But…

8
00:00:15,550 --> 00:00:18,710
- ...but not on purpose.
- What the hell, man? What the hell?

9
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:21,080
I don't know. It didn't feel right.

10
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:24,500
Right?

11
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:26,630
Right.

12
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:28,810
Getting a boner...

13
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,920
...in class is not right.

14
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:37,460
Getting a boner while my doctor is giving me the cough test, is that right?

15
00:00:39,850 --> 00:00:44,960
But getting a boner while I'm about to have sex with the girl I love...

16
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:48,290
...is the only right time to have a boner, you asshole.

17
00:00:48,310 --> 00:00:51,320
Hey, don't compare me to those guys! I said I was sorry.

18
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:55,230
You even had a boner with Sally today, arrgh!

19
00:00:56,470 --> 00:00:58,390
So, what wrong with that?

20
00:00:59,170 --> 00:01:00,490
Excuse me?

21
00:01:01,650 --> 00:01:03,690
So, what wrong with that?

22
00:01:04,690 --> 00:01:05,930
What's wrong with that is...

23
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:09,340
...that Sally is a gross ass Sally.

24
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:11,680
Vanessa...

25
00:01:11,870 --> 00:01:14,930
...is the hottest bitch I've ever seen. 

26
00:01:15,850 --> 00:01:19,030
She is the hot little Jewish girl.

27
00:01:19,090 --> 00:01:20,690
Okay, I know.

28
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:24,420
Look Joey: if you wanna try to have sex again, ...

29
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:26,580
...maybe Sally is not such a bad idea.

30
00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:29,260
I mean, okay, yeah I know, she's a Sally. But...

31
00:01:30,310 --> 00:01:31,750
...her Miss Cooter...

32
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:34,520
...she's something kinda...

33
00:01:35,390 --> 00:01:37,070
...something.

34
00:01:37,850 --> 00:01:39,280
I hate you.

35
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:41,980
What?

36
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:44,580
I hate you. You're nothing to me.

37
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:47,540
Joey, don't say that.

38
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:50,270
I wish I were born without a dick.

39
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:56,470
Or as a girl or something.

40
00:02:06,130 --> 00:02:07,630
Well, ...

41
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:09,660
...I wish...

42
00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:13,890
...that I wasn't the dick of someone who's such a smartass all the time!

43
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:16,320
You go to hell.

44
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:20,180
- Hey, hey hey! Where do you think you're going?
- I go and find Miss Cooter.

45
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:24,890
- She's the only person who understands me.
- Oh no, you're not! We're going back to Vanessa's...

46
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:28,250
and we're gonna bend for forgiveness and you are gonna work this time!

47
00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:31,130
No way, shithead! It's never gonna go down like that.

48
00:02:31,390 --> 00:02:34,460
- I'm gonna find Miss Cooter!
- No, you're not!

49
00:02:34,510 --> 00:02:36,250
Yes, I am!

50
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:36,990
No!

51
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:38,170
- Yes!
- No!

52
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:39,300
Yes!

53
00:03:00,890 --> 00:03:02,410
I'm outta here.

54
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:10,060
Fine! [high pitched]

55
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:11,850
Get out.

56
00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:13,660
Who needs you? 

57
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:19,580
He's gone.

58
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:23,340
He's gone.

59
00:03:25,850 --> 00:03:27,430
He's gone.

60
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:29,640
He's gone.

61
00:03:31,890 --> 00:03:34,030
Oh, he's gone!

62
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:37,720
Why, hello there, Joey.

63
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:40,170
I thought that [???] would never leave.

64
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:42,270
Who are you?

65
00:03:43,330 --> 00:03:44,590
Who am I? 

66
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:46,650
Why, I'm you, Joey.

67
00:03:46,770 --> 00:03:48,830
Or at least a part of you...

68
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:50,960
...that maybe you forgot about.

69
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:53,330
Here, ...

70
00:03:54,690 --> 00:03:56,420
...pick a card.

71
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,490
- What's it say, kid?
- Three of clubs.

72
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:02,040
What?!? Give me that!

73
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:03,850
Sorry.

74
00:04:03,970 --> 00:04:05,000
It's a new trick.

75
00:04:05,270 --> 00:04:08,740
But just imagine who neat it would have been, if It had said this.

76
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:12,100
- Wow, the nine of hearts.
- That's right, the king of hearts. 

77
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:14,570
I'm your heart, Joey. 

78
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:17,310
Blood pumping extraordinairst. 

79
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:19,770
Strongest muscle in your body and...

80
00:04:20,150 --> 00:04:23,090
...certified expert in the field of love...

81
00:04:23,210 --> 00:04:26,200
...and all things romantical. My degree.

82
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,640
- It's blank.
- Well, you don't need an degree...

83
00:04:30,650 --> 00:04:33,820
...to know that everything you've been doing with this Vanessa girl is all wrong. 

84
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:35,140
Stupidly wrong! 

85
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:37,940
Dreadfully, dreadfully wrong, Joey!

86
00:04:41,450 --> 00:04:43,660
Hey, I almost had sex with her!

87
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:44,610
Arrgh!

88
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:50,820
Wrong, Joey.

89
00:04:50,850 --> 00:04:53,780
You just look like a boob.

90
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:56,380
While waving your...

91
00:04:56,670 --> 00:04:59,220
...waving your wiener around in a base like a...

92
00:04:59,530 --> 00:05:00,700
...like a hot dog bender.

93
00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:03,450
With the hot dogs, Joey? 
- Yeah.

94
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:05,090
[???].

95
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,360
Ugh!

96
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:12,730
Besides, Joey, ...

97
00:05:12,930 --> 00:05:15,540
...girls don't mind to have sex. 

98
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:18,950
It's a common misconception, made up by...

99
00:05:19,550 --> 00:05:20,640
...somebody.

100
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:25,510
- Well, what do girls like?
- What do girls like?!? Joey, ...

101
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:28,920
...what do all of history's greatest lovers have in common?

102
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:35,300
Romeo and Juliet? Anthony and Cleopatra? Jack Dawson and Kate Winslet's character?

103
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:40,330
All the guys die horribly first.

104
00:05:40,370 --> 00:05:43,110
Ahem... bad examples! But how about...

105
00:05:43,230 --> 00:05:46,490
- ...Spiderman and Mary Jane?
- Oh, yeah! They work out perfectly.

106
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:48,060
They sure do.

107
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:53,280
What ties them together in a beautiful turn of fate, Joseph?

108
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:57,130
Romance, Joey. Romance.

109
00:05:57,610 --> 00:06:00,810
- Romance.
- Something you're going to have to acquaint yourself with.

110
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:04,970
Here... read this! It's a Jane Austin novel, Joey.

111
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:14,390
Because if you want this Vanessa, you're gonna have to [???] the girl a bit.

112
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:18,650
Yeah, I don't know, Heart. I looked like a real jerkass back there, and I don't even think she likes me.

113
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:19,970
What?!? 

114
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:21,680
Joey, that's silly.

115
00:06:22,710 --> 00:06:25,110
You're just the cutest boy I've ever seen. With a...

116
00:06:25,230 --> 00:06:27,610
- ...[???] I just wanna kiss.
- No, she hate me.

117
00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:30,300
Oh, that's certainly possible. 

118
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:33,170
But remember Joey, what Jane Austin once said:

119
00:06:33,290 --> 00:06:40,090
Sometimes your one true love turns out to be the person you...

120
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:42,640
...initially...

121
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:44,190
...disliked.

122
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:49,470
- When did Jane Austin say that?
- In one of her [???].

123
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:51,000
I'm sure, Joey.

124
00:06:51,890 --> 00:06:55,040
Now, Joey, just listen to me and I shan't stir you wrong.

125
00:06:56,150 --> 00:06:59,020
- You're really help me get Vanessa?
- Absolutely!

126
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:01,460
Wow.

127
00:07:01,510 --> 00:07:04,440
That's my boy, Joey. So what do you say?

128
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:11,980
Are you ready to romance this girl? Are you ready to give 223 percent to this effort?

129
00:07:12,350 --> 00:07:14,790
- I sure am!
- Huzzar, Joey!

130
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:17,190
Now listen up! And listen good...

131
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:20,770
...as I illuminate the possibilities.

132
00:07:21,770 --> 00:07:24,290
You look a little down, Joey.

133
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:27,020
You look a little blue.

134
00:07:28,110 --> 00:07:32,380
It looks as though your dick has run a little way from you.

135
00:07:33,650 --> 00:07:36,350
He hung you out to dry, Joey.

136
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:38,980
I think you will agree, ...

137
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:42,310
...the world would be much better, ...

138
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:49,580
...If you listened, a little bit, to me.

139
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:56,300
Listen to your heart, Joey. Listen to your heart.

140
00:07:56,620 --> 00:08:00,820
Comb your hair and smile, that's a start.

141
00:08:00,850 --> 00:08:06,390
Wipe that schmutz right off your cheek. Give her a glimpse of that fine physique.

142
00:08:06,510 --> 00:08:11,280
And a splash of cologne will delight. Treat the lady right, Joey.

143
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:14,190
Treat the lady right.

144
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:19,040
Take off your hat and always be polite.

145
00:08:19,090 --> 00:08:21,580
Offer your handkerchief, give her your pin.

146
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:24,340
Open the door when she wants to walk in.

147
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:29,990
Shell never resist, mon cheri. Take her to Paris.

148
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:35,640
And look up at the tower. Every night on the hour.

149
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:38,940
Let the lights have their way.

150
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:44,480
Take her in your arms. Speak of life and devotion.

151
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:47,590
Then propose by the ocean.

152
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:50,540
So she'll promise to stay.

153
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:53,340
So she won't go away.

154
00:08:53,410 --> 00:08:56,520
Don't let her get away, Joey. 

155
00:08:56,540 --> 00:08:59,590
She can't get away!

156
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:05,210
Show her that you care, Joey. Show her that you care.

157
00:09:05,490 --> 00:09:10,180
Pass her a note that says: "You're beyond compare".

158
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:15,490
Make her a mix tape with songs about love. Knit her a sweater that fits like a glove.

159
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:20,490
The two of you will never be apart. Joey, listen to your heart!

160
00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:22,610
Come on, boy. Come on.

161
00:09:23,010 --> 00:09:24,710
How are you doing this?

162
00:09:25,570 --> 00:09:26,890
But how am I doing that?

163
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:28,550
Then use your [???], Joey.

164
00:09:28,550 --> 00:09:30,800
- Pretend you're a [???].
- But I don't have a [???].

165
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:32,380
[???]

166
00:09:32,990 --> 00:09:36,400
- Oh my god, my heart is so talented.
- That's right.

167
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:40,210
Come on, kid. Bring it home!

168
00:09:41,890 --> 00:09:45,690
And soon shell love us, like we love her.

169
00:09:45,890 --> 00:09:49,220
Who knows what tomorrow could bring?

170
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:53,990
The time is right, to make your/my move.

171
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:57,990
It's time to give her the ring.

172
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:04,850
- So, Joey. What are you gonna do?
- I'm gonna listen to my heart.

173
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:08,660
- Oh buddy, it's my big debut.
- I'm gonna listen to my heart.

174
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:12,690
You're gonna listen, ...

175
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:15,810
...listen...

176
00:10:15,930 --> 00:10:20,850
...to your...

177
00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:23,500
...heart.
