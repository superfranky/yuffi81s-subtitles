1
00:00:01,550 --> 00:00:07,220
Sally, sugar, when you're done with that, we've gotta figure out what we're gonna do with Joey.

2
00:00:07,530 --> 00:00:11,050
I'm all a flutter in the gutter, if you know what I mean.

3
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:13,890
Oh, Miss Cooter, I don't know what to say to him.

4
00:00:14,230 --> 00:00:18,180
Well, it's easy. You say: "Joseph Michael Richter. ...

5
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:22,710
... I am desperately in love with you. If you had half a brain, ...

6
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:27,010
...you would sweep me off my feet and carry me to some Caribbean isle...

7
00:00:27,380 --> 00:00:29,600
...and make wild passioned love to me, ...

8
00:00:29,650 --> 00:00:32,790
...‘till I die a naked and sexy death."

9
00:00:34,010 --> 00:00:36,970
I mean to ask him if he wants to study tonight.

10
00:00:38,290 --> 00:00:42,650
[???] a girl approve a pussy for good. But alright.

11
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:49,330
- Joey?
- Yeah?

12
00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:53,250
Ugh! Hey, man. Who ordered the salad, right?

13
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:56,480
Please, don't touch me with your penis!

14
00:00:57,510 --> 00:01:00,750
Joey Richter touched me with his dick.

15
00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:03,990
I heard Joey Richter ate his [???] once, ‘cause his dick told him to.

16
00:01:04,370 --> 00:01:07,820
I heard Joey Richter cries in the choir room.

17
00:01:07,850 --> 00:01:10,380
Gosh, he's such a loser!

18
00:01:10,410 --> 00:01:12,620
- Looks like an old lesbian.
- Yeah!

19
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:16,450
- Dick!
- I'm sorry, What...?

20
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:18,970
- Joey?  - I, uhm...
- What?!?

21
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:21,470
Carib - bean sex! Caribbean SEX!

22
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:24,240
I wanna have Caribbean study with you!

23
00:01:28,390 --> 00:01:29,720
Tell ya: ...

24
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:31,980
that's the dumbest thing I've ever heard.

25
00:01:32,890 --> 00:01:36,390
One thing: I'm not even in ‘world cultures' with you, okay?

26
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:39,470
Weren't you talking about some chemistry project earlier, though?

27
00:01:39,790 --> 00:01:43,240
- Uhm, yeah, I...
- Did somebody say: chemistry project?

28
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:45,440
‘Cause we were just discussing it.

29
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:47,980
- So who you guys gonna partner with? 
- Well, actually Joey and I were gonna...

30
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,740
Vanessa needs a partner really, really bad, you guys.

31
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:55,310
No more partners, please!

32
00:01:55,430 --> 00:01:57,730
So yeah, Joey, I was thinking...

33
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:01,120
I was thinking, we could partner up.

34
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:09,290
Whoa, what the, what the, what the, what about...

35
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:12,550
What about Rick?

36
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:16,740
Well, - Rick and I broke up, actually.

37
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:19,590
Whoot?!?

38
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:24,440
Oh yeah, and aren't you parents gone all weekend?

39
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:28,790
That would be a perfect time for you and Joey to work on this alone...

40
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:34,160
...in the master bedroom. You know, the one with the mirror on the ceiling.

41
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:38,150
- Mirrors? Her parents are kinky, man!
- I know.

42
00:02:38,210 --> 00:02:40,520
That's an inherited trait.

43
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:44,980
This is what [???] was talking ‘bout in chemistry class. I knew it!

44
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:48,600
Okay, Joey. This is the most important day of our life.

45
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,460
Don't fuck it up!

46
00:02:50,830 --> 00:02:54,830
Nessy and I would be partners, but sometimes a teacher is against you...

47
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:59,130
...when you work with your bff. And they grade you better, ...

48
00:02:59,170 --> 00:03:02,990
...when you work with someone you don't like. So I was thinking, we should work together, Sally.

49
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:08,400
- Well, actually Joey and I....
- You know what? I think that sounds great.

50
00:03:08,450 --> 00:03:12,590
I think, I couldn't think of a more convenient pairing for anyone involved.

51
00:03:12,890 --> 00:03:16,200
Yeah, great. So you can come over to me after school and start working, if you want.

52
00:03:17,070 --> 00:03:18,310
So...

53
00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:20,430
...come over around five?

54
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:22,210
Yes, good.

55
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,200
See you then.

56
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:26,620
Yes, good. 

57
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:33,740
My God, it's unbelievable!

58
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:36,610
Man, that's the most incredible thing that ever happened.

59
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:39,830
Do not let the spoil off the hook, Miss Sally!

60
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,340
Sally!

61
00:03:43,050 --> 00:03:45,410
Thank you so much!

62
00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:48,000
You don't know how big this is to me.

63
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:52,650
I mean I've had the biggest, secretest crush on Vanessa for as long as I can remember.

64
00:03:52,770 --> 00:03:57,670
And you know, when you are gonna school project with someone, there is just so much more going on there.

65
00:03:57,690 --> 00:04:01,390
You know? I imagine, this is who most married couple met.

66
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:04,990
By working on school-projects, just like these.

67
00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:11,000
Thank you so much for giving all that up, so I can have that with Vanessa and not with you. Thank you!

68
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:16,320
No problem, Joey. 

69
00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:18,470
- Anything for you.
- Yes! 
 - No!

70
00:04:18,590 --> 00:04:20,610
You're amazing.

71
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:32,860
Oh.

72
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:37,960
- I'm sorry, I didn't...
- JGee, its fine.

73
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:41,430
- I mean, I hope you...
- I'm alright.

74
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:45,050
- I didn't mean to...
- My name's Miss Cooter.

75
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:49,610
I'm Dick.

76
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:56,310
- You've been here before, I think.
- Who, me?

77
00:04:57,070 --> 00:05:01,940
- You slip by each time I blink.
- Couldn't be.

78
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:08,490
Yes, I've seen you around here before.

79
00:05:11,290 --> 00:05:15,870
- I thought that you never looked.
- What? How?

80
00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:20,260
- But I knew, that I was hooked.
- Now, now.

81
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:27,030
Yes, I've seen you around here before. 

82
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:35,080
All the time just knowing. Not knowing how I knew.

83
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:41,450
I've had a funny feeling about you.

84
00:05:41,970 --> 00:05:49,800
Thinking it was hopeless, I told love, adieu.

85
00:05:51,370 --> 00:05:54,020
But when we touched ...

86
00:05:54,890 --> 00:06:00,040
...and you came into view.

87
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:28,270
All the time just knowing. Not knowing how I knew.

88
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:34,380
I've had a funny feeling about you.

89
00:06:35,010 --> 00:06:43,300
Always wanting something. That something was you.

90
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:51,700
- I've never felt quite like this.
- Is that true?

91
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:57,190
I could be about to piss!

92
00:06:58,290 --> 00:07:00,400
Look at you.

93
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:08,260
Yes, I've seen you around here...

94
00:07:13,470 --> 00:07:16,030
...be-

95
00:07:16,070 --> 00:07:21,350
-fore.

96
00:07:36,690 --> 00:07:38,830
Joey Richter.

97
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:41,460
What is this? What are you doing?

98
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,210
This guy has a boner now!

99
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:48,380
- Joey Richter is wiener-wild!
- Damn it!

100
00:07:50,090 --> 00:07:52,520
I gotta go, bye!

101
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,940
Woah! Did you feel that?

102
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:06,050
Do you mean that little prig? I keep his arrow on my butthole.

103
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:09,620
Yeah, it felt good.
