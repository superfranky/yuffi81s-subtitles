1
00:00:03,660 --> 00:00:07,280
- Oh, there you are.
- So sorry.

2
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:12,010
Wow. I was beginning to think I was gonna have to do this project on my own, huh?

3
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:16,990
I wouldn't totally give up on that idea.

4
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:22,740
So, what are we doing here? A posterboard? A video on Spanish? What's up?

5
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:28,060
Well, actually the idea that I had with Joey was that we work on a soulable compound...

6
00:00:28,090 --> 00:00:34,210
...such as silver nitrate for example, AgNO3, except we make ours a film noir detective type story...

7
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:36,070
...with elements.

8
00:00:36,190 --> 00:00:38,800
Oh, like Saw!

9
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:43,590
Uhm, no.

10
00:00:44,970 --> 00:00:49,550
Let me explain: See, the trend film noir is used to describe a stylish Hollywood crime drama, ...

11
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:52,530
...mainly popular in the 40th and 50th...

12
00:00:53,630 --> 00:00:57,100
[Miss Cooter is humming "I've seen you around here before"]

13
00:00:57,990 --> 00:01:01,250
Pst! Hey kid!

14
00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:02,910
Kid.

15
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:06,920
You're gazing out in the space like you see a bunch of Martians out there.

16
00:01:06,950 --> 00:01:08,200
What gives?

17
00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:10,720
Were you talking to me?

18
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:13,970
I couldn't hear you over the sweet sound of love in the air.

19
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:17,370
Oh-oh(s). It's worse than I thought(s).

20
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:20,020
Martians I can handle, but love, uagh!

21
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:24,850
That's a threat you can't fight off with a bunch of rough fighter jets and a Will Smith taking care of it.

22
00:01:26,890 --> 00:01:30,210
So, may I be so bald(s) ass to ask(s) whom...

23
00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:32,650
...or what says you wouldn't search rare forms?

24
00:01:33,610 --> 00:01:36,700
Ah, it is some handsome young packer I've met today.

25
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:38,760
Here(s) we go(s).

26
00:01:39,010 --> 00:01:43,240
And by packer, I assume you're referring to a p-p-p-p-p-p-p...

27
00:01:44,330 --> 00:01:45,220
A cock.

28
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:50,240
A cock? [???] is more I like it.

29
00:01:50,290 --> 00:01:53,120
Man, I just can't stop thinking about him.

30
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:55,750
I'll tell you something, honey.

31
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:59,280
I've seen a lot of dicks in my day. I mean...

32
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:01,580
...a shit load of dicks.

33
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:05,150
I believe you, I believe you.

34
00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:07,650
Of course you do. I'm the Old Snatch, everyone believes me.

35
00:02:10,210 --> 00:02:13,080
I've seen every shape and size...

36
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:14,770
...from here to Timbuktu(s).

37
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:17,120
And you know what I learned about them?

38
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,200
They're nothing...

39
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,550
...but a bunch of bumps!

40
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:22,960
All of them!

41
00:02:23,130 --> 00:02:26,420
All they care about is taking a dip in our secret sauce.

42
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,990
Yeah, they might say pretty things, uagh!

43
00:02:30,330 --> 00:02:32,710
But every one of them bump(s) let(s) me down(s).

44
00:02:32,830 --> 00:02:35,060
No ma'am! No ma'am, you are wrong.

45
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:37,100
My dick is different.

46
00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:39,250
Miss Cooter, ...

47
00:02:40,210 --> 00:02:43,210
...let me tell you a thing or two about dicks.

48
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:48,420
Take those:

49
00:02:50,690 --> 00:02:52,460
A dick can act real sweet.

50
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:54,590
A dick can bat his eyes.

51
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:56,600
He can tell you you're the one...

52
00:02:56,790 --> 00:02:59,020
...but that dick's just full of lies.

53
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:03,400
A dick's a dick's a dick's a dick's a dick, it's true.

54
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:07,460
But you ain't never gonna find the dick for you.

55
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:12,080
- A dick can hit you hard.
- Ooh, a dick can hit you fast.

56
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:15,840
- A dick can bring you love.
- But that dick won't make it last.

57
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:19,970
There's a dick for every puss alots of fish in the sea.

58
00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:24,190
But they sure as hell haven't found a dick for me.

59
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:28,510
- There ain't nothing like a dick.
- And the dick I found is the best!

60
00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:32,640
There ain't nothing like a dick. They leaving you itching with a rash.

61
00:03:32,790 --> 00:03:40,920
You can play with a dildo 'til it makes you sick. But at the end of the day, there ain't nothing like a dick.

62
00:03:41,410 --> 00:03:47,200
Now you're getting it, Miss Cooter. Preach baby, preach!

63
00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:52,200
My Dick's a different breed. He's got class he's debonair.

64
00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:56,520
His voice is gravelly and soft. And baby, he's got quite a pair!

65
00:03:56,740 --> 00:04:00,710
When he talks to me I get all hot and bothered, you see.

66
00:04:00,830 --> 00:04:04,440
I'm positive that he's the only dick for me!

67
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:08,410
Ooh, that dick's got you good. He's got you under his spell.

68
00:04:08,450 --> 00:04:12,520
Well, at least I have a dick. And at least I don't smell.

69
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:20,180
Make the same mistakes, through thin and through thick. But at the end of the day, there ain't nothing like a dick.

70
00:04:20,210 --> 00:04:24,380
- I want that shaft in me today. 
 - There ain't nothing like a dick.

71
00:04:24,410 --> 00:04:26,550
Hey look, a baby on the way.

72
00:04:26,570 --> 00:04:30,450
- Ooo, the way he makes me feel.
- Oh, they sure(s) are(s) slicks.

73
00:04:30,490 --> 00:04:41,260
But at the end of the day there ain't nothing - like a dick!

74
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:43,790
And they'll fuck ya too!

75
00:04:57,390 --> 00:04:59,200
You know something, kid?

76
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:01,180
You're alright! God! 

77
00:05:01,230 --> 00:05:05,680
I haven't had that much fun since I was a tiny [???].

78
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:10,160
Oh god!

79
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:14,610
- Help! Help! Help!
- Oh, shit. One, two, three...

80
00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:16,180
Ah, there it is.

81
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,600
So tell me.

82
00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:22,120
Who's this Schmendrick that(s) got you so confound?

83
00:05:23,450 --> 00:05:27,630
Just the dick of one Joey Richter.

84
00:05:31,710 --> 00:05:33,660
Do(es) my ears deceive(s) me?

85
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:39,900
Did you just say Joey Richter(s)?

86
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:42,070
The very same, why?

87
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:43,710
No, kid.

88
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:46,460
I don't know how to break this to you, but...

89
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:49,210
...that Dick is playing you like a fiddle!

90
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:51,060
For a sap!

91
00:05:51,930 --> 00:05:53,930
What are you going on about?

92
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:56,200
You old snatch?

93
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,150
That's right, I am the old snatch.

94
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:04,070
Kid(s), I got the forewarn once that...

95
00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:08,420
...one Joey Richter(s) is doing the horizontal hockey pockey with one Vanessa.

96
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:10,410
On this very night.

97
00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:14,310
I don't know what that Dick told you, Miss Cooter.

98
00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:16,160
But it aren't(s) the truth.

99
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:18,710
He's a no good two timing bump!

100
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:21,350
- Just like the rest. 
- No, I don't believe you.

101
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:25,240
- That's impossible.
- Oh, you must really be wet.

102
00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:27,980
Behind the ears.

103
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:30,000
Quit naiveté!

104
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:36,420
I had a dick like yours once.

105
00:06:37,570 --> 00:06:39,300
Ah, my first time.

106
00:06:40,630 --> 00:06:44,450
Made me feel like I was the only vagi(s) in the world(s).

107
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:47,200
Real special, until...

108
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:52,820
Until what?

109
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:54,790
Well, ...

110
00:06:55,990 --> 00:07:01,540
...one day he was there, and the next - he(s) was gone(s).

111
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:04,620
Without a word.

112
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:06,780
Left me high(s) and dry(s).

113
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:10,500
And I haven't seen him since.

114
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:14,310
Well, I feel real bad for you.

115
00:07:14,570 --> 00:07:16,500
But that ain't gonna be my story.

116
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:21,660
I sure hope(s) you're right, kid. I sure hope(s) you're right.

117
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:29,810
…and it's only when the silver and the nitrogen find all three oxygen's. Then they solve the case!

118
00:07:30,310 --> 00:07:32,340
Oh, I'm pulling up. I'm pulling.

119
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:37,240
It's a text message from Nessy, thank god!

120
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:39,530
Can you please answer that later?

121
00:07:39,810 --> 00:07:46,190
Oh, I would, but Nessy's in a really delicate situation and might need some of my sexpertise.

122
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:53,020
What does Vanessa need sex expertise for?

123
00:07:53,510 --> 00:07:55,790
She's working on her project with Joey.

124
00:07:56,270 --> 00:07:59,390
Sally, you are smarter then you look.

125
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:04,620
Oh... alright. I don't want to give out too many dets, 'cause Nessy's like my best [???]...

126
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:06,820
...and I don't wanna break her trust, but... 

127
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:11,170
...she's hooking up with Joey right now!

128
00:08:12,370 --> 00:08:17,450
Wha... wha... what does Vanessa see in Joey Richter?

129
00:08:18,050 --> 00:08:21,340
Why do you think she want to work on this project with him?

130
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:25,080
Anything can happen during a school-project.

131
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,390
Thank you for your time and your precious day! 

132
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:37,750
I'm going to work on this project by myself!

133
00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:39,110
Cool.

134
00:08:39,230 --> 00:08:40,990
See(s), I told you, kid.

135
00:08:41,110 --> 00:08:43,130
- They're all the same.
 - No, you shut up!

136
00:08:43,370 --> 00:08:47,450
I don't know what's going on with my packer right now, but I do know, what I felt.

137
00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:52,690
What we felt! And it's something so special that probably no one else...

138
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:55,630
...in this entire universe has ever felt so before!

139
00:08:57,110 --> 00:09:00,480
Nobody except the millions stupid enough to believe a dick.

140
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:04,140
No. You just want everybody to be as miserable as you are, 'cause...

141
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:08,180
...you're a worn out, smelly old, mean old snatch!

142
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:10,000
Come on, Sally!

143
00:09:10,730 --> 00:09:11,580
Damn!

144
00:09:13,650 --> 00:09:14,710
She's right(s).
