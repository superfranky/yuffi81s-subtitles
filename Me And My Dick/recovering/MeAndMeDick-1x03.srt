1
00:00:00,730 --> 00:00:01,960
Hello?

2
00:00:01,990 --> 00:00:06,610
Hey Vaness, OMG, would you guess, that I'm not wearing undies today?

3
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:12,740
Eww. Oh Tiff, LOL, what's the diff, you would still take 'em off anyway.

4
00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:15,750
- IKR [I know, right]?
- BTW [By the way],

5
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:18,320
Where are you right now?

6
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:21,560
- We need to talk.
- Oh, I totes see you.

7
00:00:21,610 --> 00:00:29,740
BRB, ciao ciao. [Be right back]

8
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:40,740
How is you doing, Flopsy?

9
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:42,990
Oh, hey there, you old snatch!

10
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:47,890
- So, you know how the [???] act party at my house this weekend?
- Yeah.

11
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:52,450
- I hooked up with the [???].
- Really? I've heard you hooked up with the running [???].

12
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:54,400
Oh yeah. Him too!

13
00:00:55,290 --> 00:01:00,730
- Sounds like you had a rough weekend.
- Ah, no. It's just business as usual and [???]. 

14
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:03,880
I tell you, I've been with so many members of the football team, ...

15
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:06,410
- ...they're gonna give me an honorary position.
- Oh yeah?

16
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:08,480
What position they're gonna give ya?

17
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:10,410
Wide receiver.

18
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:17,480
I thought you was gonna say: tight pants.

19
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:21,230
Oh honey, it's been a long time since I've been a tight anything.

20
00:01:22,130 --> 00:01:25,810
Now, who am I kidding? What position haven't I tried?

21
00:01:29,770 --> 00:01:33,460
When you've been around the block as much as I have.

22
00:01:33,470 --> 00:01:36,590
- You feel just like a CEO.
- How's that? That must feel good.

23
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:40,780
You see, I'm done with all these cocks, but they're not letting me retire.

24
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:44,740
I tell ya, I'm ready to go!

25
00:01:47,450 --> 00:01:51,200
Tiff, you gotta stop playing with all these stupid guys. They have feelings, you know?

26
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:53,270
Oh, we are just having fun.

27
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:56,940
I guess you wouldn't know what that's like, cause you're in that whole relationships thing.

28
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:00,280
- And that's me: Miss Monogamy.
- Let me tell you something, sweetie.

29
00:02:00,290 --> 00:02:03,280
Just because there's one horse in this staple, it doesn't mean he don't care.

30
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:06,030
Flopsy! I didn't know you listen to horse riding.

31
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:10,150
I... what?!? I AIN'T! The horse has been riding me!

32
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:13,640
I tell you, you old snatch, you're lucky.

33
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:16,720
- Oh, I'm one? Oh, I'm one? Me?
- Yeah, you are. Yeah. Yeah!

34
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:18,520
This ought to be rich. Why's that?

35
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:20,500
Well, let me tell ya.

36
00:02:21,570 --> 00:02:25,860
It's like living the same way that an old pair of shoes do.

37
00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:28,910
Every day's a one man show.

38
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:33,050
They start to stink, and then there's holes, and they don't FIT the way they used to.

39
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:36,030
I've had it! I'm ready to go.

40
00:02:36,050 --> 00:02:37,440
Look at us.

41
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:40,790
- We're just a couple of stiffs.
- Now you're just being cute.

42
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:44,630
- With a lifetime of if's.
- Don't be so hard on us.

43
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:48,040
And I wonder, with someone else, ...

44
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:51,500
...could life be more fair?

45
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:55,460
- It's not like we're some one-dick pony. 
 - Oh, now you're being cute.

46
00:02:55,490 --> 00:02:58,900
We could be more, if only...

47
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:06,440
...someone out there, would answer our prayers!

48
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:13,980
While(s) we(s) wait(s) to be delivered. Go ahead, cry me a river.

49
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:17,740
We agree that there's no 'quid pro quo'.

50
00:03:17,770 --> 00:03:21,820
- So until that great vacation.
- Save your tears for lubrication.

51
00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:25,770
And lord have mercy, are we ready to go!

52
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:31,620
Mercy, are we ready to...

53
00:03:31,850 --> 00:03:36,730
...go.

54
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:41,740
So what's up with you and Rick? You guys [???] separately [???] to school today.

55
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:44,360
- Is everything okay?
- Oh-oh, shouldn't have said that.

56
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:49,240
No, it's not. We... He and I actually... broke up.

57
00:03:49,410 --> 00:03:52,810
- Here comes the waterfall.
- Okay, pinky-swear you won't spread this around!

58
00:03:52,850 --> 00:03:56,980
I heard from Stacy that Daphne was with Valerie when she saw Rick - cheating on me!

59
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,400
It's that...! It's like the best thing that's ever happened to me. I'm on vacation!

60
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:03,880
WT...

61
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:05,120
FUCK!

62
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:07,990
Oh, that asshole!

63
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:10,010
You know what you need to do?

64
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:13,180
- You need to re-cheat that motherfucker, for the win.
- What?

65
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:17,190
- You need to find a guy.
- What? Why do I fell like I'm gonna get the short end of this?

66
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:22,680
Not just any guy. A guy who's barely existence will drive Rick insane.

67
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,520
He should be like a total loser.

68
00:04:25,530 --> 00:04:28,970
[???] a definite step down.

69
00:04:29,010 --> 00:04:30,460
Like...

70
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:33,990
- ...like that guy!
- Joey Richter?!?

71
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:36,380
He's perfect. This is gonna be so epic.

72
00:04:36,410 --> 00:04:39,300
I don't know if I can just hook up with some random guy and revenge.

73
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,490
Uh uh. Epic revenge!

74
00:04:44,930 --> 00:04:47,860
Listen up, Vanessa, sweetie.

75
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:50,620
- I do this 'cause I care.
- I know.

76
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:57,950
This is war. Forget your peace treaty. Justice is right over there.

77
00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:01,810
I guess I could use a new guy. ‘Cause it's been a while...

78
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:06,270
...and I am still so young. Why not give it a try?

79
00:05:06,290 --> 00:05:10,180
At the very least it could be kinda fun.

80
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:15,740
Hey now, Vanessa, that's the girl I know and love.

81
00:05:15,790 --> 00:05:21,650
I've been so boring, boy I'm glad - I had a little shove!

82
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:27,050
Tick tock, while the iron's hot. There's no time to take it slow.

83
00:05:27,170 --> 00:05:32,730
We gotta be ready, so ready to go.

84
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:38,850
I'm ready to go.

85
00:05:40,770 --> 00:05:44,450
I'm ready to go.

86
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:50,100
I'm ready to go.

87
00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:02,410
We're finally ready and the time is right for us to light a spark.

88
00:06:02,530 --> 00:06:08,180
We're keeping it steady. With our eyes on the prize, to get us through the dark.

89
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:13,440
I know there's so much more to what I think I see.

90
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:19,460
I feel a change, and the strange thing is: it's part of me!

91
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:24,560
My hormones are freaking out, and I think I'm gonna blow!

92
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:27,970
- We're locked and loaded.
- Oh, so devoted.

93
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,690
- Low and demoted.
- Totes, just toted!

94
00:06:30,710 --> 00:06:41,940
We're finally ready, so ready to go!

95
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:52,430
Alright, let's go to class.
