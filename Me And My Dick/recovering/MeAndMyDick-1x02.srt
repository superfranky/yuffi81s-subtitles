1
00:00:04,870 --> 00:00:10,690
[Sigh]. Joey Richter. Late again in a nick of time.

2
00:00:12,730 --> 00:00:18,320
Oh jeepers. That Joey Richter really makes me feel funny.

3
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:20,270
Right here, ...

4
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:22,320
...right here ...

5
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,390
...and right here.

6
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:27,370
Is it hot in here or is it just me?

7
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:30,610
Oh, Miss Cooter, it's just you.

8
00:00:33,130 --> 00:00:37,210
I am not hot at all in any sense of the word.

9
00:00:37,210 --> 00:00:38,320
Sure? 

10
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:43,170
Cause I'm sure this springs sun is burning particularly bright this morning.

11
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:46,470
Oh, I could go for a tall glass of lemonade.

12
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:49,220
I'm sweating like stump, here.

13
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:53,610
Miss Cooter, it's got nothing to do with temperature. You're just excitable.

14
00:00:53,810 --> 00:00:55,130
And a bit ancy.

15
00:00:55,130 --> 00:00:57,680
- And frustrated!
- What?!? Why?

16
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:02,550
Because, Sally: everyday when we go to school and we're walking down the halls...

17
00:01:02,590 --> 00:01:06,000
...or changing in the lock-room I see all the other girls and their little Miss Cooters...

18
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,740
...and they seem so happy and free.

19
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:12,160
I don't know, a flutter to the [???].

20
00:01:13,010 --> 00:01:16,120
Miss Cooter, we can't do stuff like other girls.

21
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:20,360
Because in case you haven't noticed, I mean, I'm kind of a freak of nature.

22
00:01:20,950 --> 00:01:24,770
I'm gangly and I got these big dump feet.

23
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:27,390
I'm like the ugly duckling.

24
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:29,240
Except I never turn into a swan.

25
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:31,400
I'm just an ugly duck. 

26
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:35,740
Well that's your problem right there, Miss Sally. It's that attitude of yours.

27
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:39,650
You act like you've been licked before you even started fattening.

28
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:43,280
Well, I guess I could try to be more positive.

29
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:45,420
That's the spirit.

30
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:50,860
And you tell me what is one thing that you desire most in this whole cosmos.

31
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:51,870
Well...

32
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:53,260
Come on, Sally! Just say it!

33
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,660
You've got a god damn shrine devoted to him in your closet.

34
00:01:56,970 --> 00:01:58,760
Joey Richter.

35
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:02,610
You should snatch him up like the last bit of cheese-cake.

36
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:06,360
I don't know, Miss Cooter. I don't think he likes me like that.

37
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:08,210
Why would he?

38
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:14,300
Look at me, with my pigtails so tight, you'd think that I might explode, right?

39
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:19,370
Look at me, with my arms in a twist, not alarming I missed the right road.

40
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:25,280
It's not too late, to turn around and find a better way.

41
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:31,210
It's not up to fate to lay the groundwork for a better day!

42
00:02:31,210 --> 00:02:36,810
You gotta shake it up, put your hair down darling. You really need to unwind.

43
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:44,480
I've gotta pick it up 'cause my life is calling me on the other line.

44
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:51,130
It's time to start over and today is like the first day of the year.

45
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:57,270
So get that chip off my shoulder,'Cause it's weighing me down and keeping you right here.

46
00:02:57,270 --> 00:03:02,250
I want to get out, see the great big world out there.

47
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:08,340
It's time to set out, 'cause I feel: there's something in the air.

48
00:03:08,350 --> 00:03:12,960
I might be that be losing my mind, but there's one thing that I know: ...

49
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:18,310
...that I'm finally ready, so ready to go!

50
00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:26,530
- I'm finally ready, I'm ready tooo... 
 - Whoo, there she goes, y'all.

51
00:03:26,530 --> 00:03:28,360
Yo, you're ready to go or what?

52
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:31,650
Yeah. Alright, let's go.

53
00:03:31,770 --> 00:03:35,360
Fine, Miss Sally. There he is. You better show what you're made of.

54
00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:45,270
Joey? Ahem, I wanted to ask you, ahem... If you, ahem...

55
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:49,760
See? This is exactly what I'm talking about. It's like: 'Nyaha Sally'.

56
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:54,850
I wanted to know if - if you want to be chemistry-partners with me?

57
00:03:55,420 --> 00:03:58,780
Poetry! That will sure set his heart on fire. Come on!

58
00:03:59,090 --> 00:04:01,860
- Yeah, sure. Sure. 
 - Great.

59
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:05,850
Okay, we're supposed to do this project on several of the elements on the periodic table.

60
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:10,240
And I was thinking if we could do one of the soulable compounds, such as silver nitrate for example, ...

61
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:15,380
AgNO3  except we can make ours fun and interesting, ...

62
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:19,520
...because we can do a film noir detective type story ...

63
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:27,220
- Hey dick, does my hair look alright?
- Hell, yeah, buddy, you're a sight to see.

64
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:33,060
Okay good. Listen up: just try to relax, 'Cause a mishap's the last thing I need.

65
00:04:33,130 --> 00:04:38,950
I wanna rise up to the next level. Get off this middle ground.

66
00:04:38,990 --> 00:04:45,240
I've got this yearnin', burnin' like the devil. I'm here for the rebound.

67
00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:50,100
- Pass the ball! I know I'm on fire.
- Yeah, yeah you're on a roll.

68
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:54,100
- I know.
- What do you want from your kingdom, sire?

69
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:58,330
-I wanna take control! 
 -Hyo!

70
00:04:58,390 --> 00:05:04,400
I need a brand new game plan. No more warming benches like I've done before.

71
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:07,420
Just get your head in the game, man! Here's what I'm thinking…

72
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:11,020
Shit, she's coming out that door.

73
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:15,900
Ahhhhhhhhhh.

74
00:05:16,910 --> 00:05:23,670
Ahhhhhhhhhh.

75
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:33,170
Say 'yes', Vanessa 'yes', I must confess of my obsession...

76
00:05:33,210 --> 00:05:43,720
...with your design. I will not rest. No, not unless I find a way to make you mine.

77
00:05:46,290 --> 00:05:57,980
- I'm gonna get her if it's the last thing that I do.
- But just remember you can't get her without me too!

78
00:05:58,010 --> 00:06:02,900
So buckle up, all you amateurs! 'Cause today we're going pro.

79
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:07,730
We're finally ready, yeah, so ready to go!

80
00:06:09,290 --> 00:06:16,840
...and it's only when the silver and the nitrogen find all three oxygen's. Then they solve the case.

81
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:18,220
Calm down!

82
00:06:18,790 --> 00:06:22,400
Joey? Have you been listening to anything I've been saying?

83
00:06:22,450 --> 00:06:26,470
- Yeah, yeah. It's awesome.
- Fine, Joey Richter.

84
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:28,430
Okay, let's go to homeroom.

85
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:31,960
Hello?
